with racial identity leong was born on november in san francisco chinatown an ethnic enclave of recent chinese immigrants to the united states leong grew up in this area during pre and post world war ii where he battled constant prejudice as an asian american leong suffered from a discriminatory attack as a child that left him partially blind in one eye asian americans who were not japanese during world war ii wore special badges to indicate and identify their ethnicity because they did not want to be mistaken for being an enemy during a time when the united states was at war with japan because of this leong wore a button that indicated his chinese descent each badge cost and leong would often lose them he stated i really felt there was a lot of misunderstanding on the part of the whites in san francisco as to what being chinese meant leong first encounter with art was when he was introduced by his father to a co worker named alan cole cole was a painter and photographer of the world fair leong studied oil painting under cole for six years growing up leong and his family had differing opinions on his future career as leong desired to become an artist while his family preferred he begin a career in medicine at age leong worked for the chinese press business leaders from chinatown commissioned leong to create a mural of chinese american history this painting was named one hundred years history of the chinese in america and was commissioned to be placed in ping yuen the first federally funded public housing in chinatown leong was awarded a scholarship and received a master degree in fine arts at california college of arts and crafts in he also went on to receive his master of arts in arts education at san francisco state university in he was inspired by the work of artists like walt kuhn yasuo kuniyoshi and dong kingman during this time leong grew strong friendships with fellow artists like nathan oliveira and clayton pinkerton he and other artists would spend their time in the famous bohemian hot spots of san francisco such as the iron pot restaurant vesuvios bar and city lights bookstore in when leong was he traveled to norway with his then wife karen and son kim for two years on a fulbright scholarship after this he also received a guggenheim fellowship that took leong and his then family to rome where he painted and focused on abstract art at the american academy there he converted the fifteenth century palazzo pio into a haven for artists here leong would sublet spaces to other artists including cy twombly and warrington colescott through his experience of years in rome leong found that the italian people were far more accepting of his chinese american identity than that of those in his home country i think more than anything else it gave me a sense of self and assurance that you don have here people in america are constantly questioning who you are what you are there always a stratum here that you have to belong to this acceptance sparked leong own exploration of his chinese american roots in his artwork along with a trip to china with his wife and son leong was soon expressing this new rediscovery of identity in his paintings that opened up all kinds of things i realized i was always chinese but there the duality of taking the next step as an american you can never really be chinese even if you speak it and know the culture there a part of you that american that so different and those are the things that came out of my paintings leong art is best characterized as abstract expressionism with the subjects and interests of his paintings constantly changing over time he shifted from painting the relationships of nature and humans to painting the historic relationships of east and west after living for three decades in italy leong settled in pioneer square in seattle in finding the town to be the perfect blend of san francisco and europe there he served as arts commissioner and on advisory boards for several museums in leong was nominated for a national medal for the arts from the national endowment of the arts leong died from congestive heart failure on april at the swedish medical center he was

protected persons under international humanitarian law in accordance with the first and second geneva conventions and their additional protocols which established legally binding rules guaranteeing neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers field or ship medical personnel and specific humanitarian institutions in an armed conflict international humanitarian law makes no distinction between medical personnel who are members of the armed forces and who hold military ranks and those who are civilian volunteers all medical personnel are considered non combatants under international humanitarian law because of their humanitarian duties and they may not be attacked and not be taken as prisoners of war hospitals and other medical facilities and transports identified as such whether they are military or civilian may not be attacked either the red cross the red crescent and the red crystal are the protective signs recognised under international humanitarian law and are used by military medical personnel and facilities for this purpose attacking military medical personnel patients in their care or medical facilities or transports legitimately marked as such is a war crime likewise misusing these protective signs to mask military operations is the war crime of perfidy military medical personnel may be armed usually with service pistols for the purpose of self defense or the defense of patients the significance of military medicine for combat strength goes far beyond treatment of battlefield injuries in every major war fought until the late th century disease claimed more soldier casualties than did enemy action during the american civil war for example about twice as many soldiers died of disease as were killed or mortally wounded in combat the franco prussian war is considered to have been the first conflict in which combat injury exceeded disease at least in the german coalition army which lost of its average headcount to combat and only to disease in new world countries such as australia new zealand the united states and canada military physicians and surgeons contributed significantly to the development of civilian health care improvements in military medicine have increased the survival rates in successive wars due to improvements in medical evacuation battlefield medicine and trauma care similar improvements have been seen in trauma practices during the iraq war some military trauma care practices are disseminated by citizen soldiers who return to civilian practice one such practice is where major trauma patients are transferred to an operating theater as soon as possible to stop internal bleeding increasing the survival rate within the united states the survival rate for gunshot wounds has increased leading to apparent declines in the gun death rate in states that have stable rates of gunshot hospitalizations in many english speaking countries the military title of surgeon is applied to any medical practitioner due to the historical evolution of the term the us army medical corps retains various surgeon united states military occupation codes in the ranks of officer pay grades for military personnel dedicated to performing surgery on wounded soldiers according to a study which examined inter state wars from onwards found that militaries that have better military medicine have improved military effectiveness

in and based partly on the folk tale ali baba and the forty thieves it was collected most recently in the book the rediscovery of man the story details the methods by which the norstrilians or old north australians of smith fictional instrumentality of mankind universe maintain their monopoly on the valuable immortality drug stroon the story details part of the background for the novel norstrilia which references the kittons in its introduction as a method for certain death the story was alluded to in charles stross novel glasshouse cordwainer smith is a pseudonym of paul linebarger the noted china expert who wrote most of his published science fiction stories within the setting of the instrumentality of mankind for many millennia the rather static structure of the instrumentality of mankind on those planets which the instrumentality directly administered was of lords of the instrumentality ruling over humans who were allowed a fixed year lifespan and a large number of exploited animal derived underpeople servants the use of the immortality drug stroon from the world of norstrilia was a vital tool in maintaining this order the planet of norstrilia or in full the commonwealth of old north australia was settled by sheep farmers who ultimately hailed from a post nuclear war australia through with many vicissitudes such as a stay on the hell world paradise vii before they found their current prosperity the political system is based on a monarchy with her absent majesty the queen as nominal head of state however the queen has been lost for millennia but she might bloody well turn up one of these days a local deputy and commonwealth council until her nominal return the municipal organization of the planet is based on ranches la cattle stations large farm allotments passed down through generations the sheep that were brought to this planet by the australian immigrants suffer a local infection that causes them to grow larger than houses completely immobile they require constant attention the infection also generates stroon also called the santaclara drug which halts aging in humans stroon has made norstrilia the richest planet in the entire instrumentality and its people are thus targets of kidnap and theft attempts the citizens are highly trained in self defense but the planet strategically maintains mother hitton littul kittons for its defense viola siderea is a robber planet once rich and civilized but now reduced to a dog eat dog existence which has created a ruling class of highly sophisticated thieves benjacomin bozart is a warden of the thieves guild trained and prepared to raid norstrilia for its stroon due to the impossibility of overpowering a norstrilian adult he ruthlessly drugs and kills a small norstrilian boy on a vacation world to discover the exact nature of the planet defenses but the only information he gets is the name mother hitton littul kittons scrawled in the sand on the beach he consults the guild encyclopedia which says that the phrase is an archaic term for the disease caused by the stroon virus a fictitious entry planted by another norstrilian agent long ago now confident of somehow obtaining stroon bozart pays out immense bribes using viola siderea credit to illicitly charter ships further unaware that he is paying other norstrilian agents who have tracked him since he murdered the child the last leg of the journey drops his space yacht into orbit around norstrilia where he meets a hideous fate a faceted moon and a network of relay stations orbit the planet they are the armament of mother hitton the weapons mistress in charge of the care and feeding of the littul kittons which are in fact mink which have been selectively bred for centuries for psychotic self destructive madness of necessity they spend almost the entirety of their lives under anaesthesia and are only awakened to mate or when needed for defense the brain patterns of these mad mink when awakened into frenzy are focused into an intense telepathic beam that can be directed at any incoming space ship from the relay station driving all humans into immediate suicidal psychosis as bozart discovers first hand tearing out an eyeball in the process the odd spelling of the littul kittons was intentional as research into the term would act as a tripwire alerting the norstrilian defenses to potential hostile activity after his death the extent of the norstrilians revenge is revealed bozart bribes have incurred a debt of million man megayears for viola siderea faking a murderer is a canadian mockumentary film directed by stuart stone and released in an affectionate parody of the true crime genre the film stars stone and his filmmaking partner and brother in law adam rodness as themselves trying to make a true crime documentary about their efforts to track down david stoner a man they have found seemingly confessing to murders in a series of bloody internet videos at the outset of the project stone and rodness made a number of short videos with actor tony nappo playing david stoner in grisly bloody scenarios that were deliberately ambiguous about whether they represented murders or not and posted them to a private youtube channel from there they proceeded to pitch the project as if the videos were real in order to get genuine unscripted reactions out of their friends and family the police and executives for breakthrough entertainment and hollywood suite only once they re out on stoner trail do fictionalized scenes scripted and performed by actors begin to enter the narrative the film premiered on october on hollywood suite as part of the channel shocktober lineup of hallowe en horror programming it screened at various international horror film festivals and was released to international video on demand platforms in bobby lepire of film threat wrote that the film mix of horror and comedy tones don always mesh together neatly but concluded that the film ultimately proves worthy of a recommendation rodness and stone are smart enough to understand that a story such as this can only have one inevitable conclusion as a result they don try to pull the rug out from under viewers and the final few minutes generate what is probably the largest belly laugh of the entire production the film production and release earned stone and rodness a reputation as pranksters in november when a truck containing approximately worth of production equipment was stolen from the set of their narrative comedy film vandits they were widely believed at

the craters hartwig and schl ter that lie on the northeastern edge of montes cordillera a ring shaped range that surrounds mare orientale due to its location riccioli appears strongly foreshortened from the earth and is viewed almost from the side riccioli is older than the orientale basin to the southwest because the ejecta from the impact that created the orientale basin overlies the crater this debris lies in ridges that regionally trend northeast southwest but trend in a direction parallel to riccioli northeast wall in that part of the crater a system of rilles named the rimae riccioli lies across the interior and crosscut the ejecta ridges in the northern half of the interior the dark covering of lava that resurfaced the floor is visible and covers some of the ejecta ridges and

burns routing had been excised this practice did not last long and original baldwin pickguards appeared shortly afterwards identical to the burns originals save for the baldwin routing other
