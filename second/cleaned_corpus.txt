we investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of listprocessing tasks in llms and we find that llms have learned to encode a compact causal representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic filter function of functional programming using causal mediation analysis on a diverse set of listprocessing tasks we find that a small number of attention heads which we dub filter heads encode a compact representation of the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens we demonstrate that this predicate representation is general and portable it can be extracted and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections presented in different formats languages or even in tasks however we also identify situations where transformer lms can exploit a different strategy for filtering eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations our results reveal that transformer lms can develop humaninterpretable implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways that are surprisingly ilar to strategies used in traditional functional programming patterns as increasingly capable agents are deployed a central safety question is how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system we study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act autonomously play or defer ask while a human ultaneously chooses whether to be permissive trust or to engage in oversight oversee if the agent defers the humans choice determines the outcome potentially leading to a corrective action or a system shutdown we model this interaction as a twoplayer markov game our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies as a markov potential game mpg a class of games where we can provide an alignment guarantee under a structural assumption on the humans value function any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits itself cannot harm the humans value we also analyze extensions to this mpg framework theoretically this perspective provides conditions for a specific form of intrinsic alignment if the reward structures of the humanagent game meet these conditions we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its own outcome will not harm the humans practically this model motivates a transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to defer when risky and act when safe while its pretrained policy and the environments reward structure remain untouched our gridworld ulation shows that through independent learning the agent and human discover their optimal oversight roles the agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns when to oversee leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety violations introduced posttraining this demonstrates a practical method for making misaligned models safer after deployment this paper presents a comprehensive crossplatform evaluation of reasoning capabilities in contemporary foundation models establishing an infrastructureagnostic benchmark across three

assumptions establish training data quality as more critical than model size and provide actionable guidelines for model selection across educational production and research contexts the triinfrastructure methodology and problem benchmark enable longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve multimodal large language models mllms exhibit a pronounced preference for textual inputs when processing visionlanguage data limiting their ability to reason effectively from visual evidence unlike prior studies that attribute this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction tuning we propose that the bias originates from the models internal architecture specifically we hypothesize that visual key vectors visual keys are outofdistribution ood relative to the text key space learned during languageonly pretraining consequently these visual keys receive systematically lower ilarity scores during attention computation leading to their underutilization in the context representation to validate this hypothesis we extract key vectors from llava and qwenvl and analyze their distributional structures using qualitative tsne and quantitative jensenshannon divergence methods the results provide direct evidence that visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention space the intermodal divergence is statistically significant exceeding intramodal variation by several orders of magnitude these findings reveal that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key space rather than solely from external data factors authorizing large language model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools and access protected resources introduces significant risks since current methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope we introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources and issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the agents assigned tasks given the unavailability of datasets centered on delegated authorization flows particularly including both semantically appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task we introduce astra a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes our experiments show both the potential and current limitations of modelbased matching particularly as the number of scopes needed for task completion increases our results highlight the need for further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intentaware authorization for multiagent and toolaugmented applications including finegrained control such as taskbased access control tbac we envision a new era of ai termed agentic organization where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence to realize this vision we introduce asynchronous thinking asyncthink as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures specifically we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns subqueries to workers merges intermediate knowledge and produces coherent solutions more importantly the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning experiments demonstrate that asyncthink achieves lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning moreover asyncthink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic modality such as obligation and permission while large language models llms have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks their ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored in this paper we systematically evaluate llms reasoning capabilities in the normative domain from both logical and modal perspectives specifically to assess how well llms reason with normative modals we make a comparison between their reasoning with normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals which share a common formal structure to this end we introduce a new dataset covering a wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic domains while also incorporating nonformal cognitive factors that influence human reasoning our results indicate that although llms generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases ilar to those observed in psychological studies of human reasoning these findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in llms normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability all data and code are released publicly at the electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in residential demand response capacity yet home energy management systems hems adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters while large language models have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter extractors no existing implementation deploys llms as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multiappliance scheduling this paper presents an agentic ai hems where llms autonomously coordinate multiappliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control achieving optimal scheduling without example

guidance remains unreliable despite models general reasoning capabilities we opensource the complete system including orchestration logic agent prompts tools and web interfaces to enable reproducibility extension and future research we present edgerunner a finetuned version of gptossb optimized for military tasks edgerunner was trained on highquality records curated from military documentation and websites we also present four new tests sets a combat arms combat medic cyber operations and milbenchk general military knowledge on these military test sets edgerunner matches or exceeds gpt task performance with statistical significance except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low reasoning setting on the milbenchk test set versus gptossb there is no statisticallysignificant regression on generalpurpose benchmarks like arcc gpqa diamond gsmk ifeval mmlu pro or truthfulqa except for gsmk in the low reasoning setting we also present analyses on hyperparameter settings cost and throughput these findings show that small locallyhosted models are ideal solutions for datasensitive operations such as in the military domain allowing for deployment in airgapped edge devices human feedback is critical for aligning ai systems to human values as ai capabilities improve and ai is used to tackle more challenging tasks verifying quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging this paper explores how we can leverage ai to improve the quality of human oversight we focus on an important safety problem that is already challenging for humans factverification of ai outputs we find that combining ai ratings and human ratings based on ai rater confidence is better than relying on either alone giving humans an ai factverification assistant further improves their accuracy but the type of assistance matters displaying ai explanation confidence and labels leads to overreliance but just showing search results and evidence fosters more appropriate trust these results have implications for amplified oversight the challenge of combining humans and ai to supervise ai systems even as they surpass human expert performance karl marx once wrote that the human essence is the ensemble of social relations suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities within which contexts play a constitutive and essential role with the advent of computers and artificial intelligence these contexts are no longer limited to purely humanhuman interactions humanmachine interactions are included as well then a central question emerges how can machines better understand our situations and purposes to address this challenge researchers have recently introduced the concept of context engineering although it is often regarded as a recent innovation of the agent era we argue that related practices can be traced back more than twenty years since the early the field has evolved through distinct historical phases each shaped by the intelligence level of machines from early humancomputer interaction frameworks built around primitive computers to todays humanagent interaction paradigms driven by intelligent agents and potentially to humanlevel or superhuman intelligence in the future in this paper we situate context engineering provide a systematic definition outline its historical and conceptual landscape and examine key design considerations for practice by addressing these questions we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context engineering and sketch its promising future this paper is a stepping stone for a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in ai systems human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving making them difficult to analyze comprehensively legal case documents offer rich factual and procedural insights into these networks but are often long unstructured and filled with ambiguous or shifting references posing significant challenges for automated knowledge graph kg construction existing methods either overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking we propose linkkg a modular framework that integrates a threestage llmguided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream kg extraction at the core of our approach is a typespecific prompt cache which consistently tracks and resolves references across document chunks enabling clean and disambiguated narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long legal texts linkkg reduces average node duplication by and noisy nodes by compared to baseline methods resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures these improvements establish linkkg as a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks large language models llms such as chatgpt are increasingly integrated into highstakes decisionmaking yet little is known about their susceptibility to social influence we conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with gpto in a hiring context in a baseline study gpt consistently favored the same candidate profile reported moderate expertise and high certainty and rarely changed its choice in study gpt gpt faced unanimous opposition from eight ulated partners and almost always conformed reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated selfreported informational and normative conformity in study gpt gpt interacted with a single partner and still conformed in of disagreement trials reporting less certainty and more normative conformity across studies results demonstrate that gpt does not act as an independent observer but adapts to perceived social consensus these findings highlight risks of treating llms as neutral decision aids and underline the need to elicit ai judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions large reasoning models lrms achieve higher task performance by allocating more inferencetime compute and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may also strengthen safety by improving refusal yet we find the opposite the same reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards we introduce chainofthought hijacking a jailbreak attack on reasoning models the attack pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning across harmbench cot hijacking reaches a and attack success rate asr on gemini pro gpt mini grok mini and claude sonnet respectively far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for lrms to understand the effectiveness of our attack we turn to a mechanistic analysis which shows that mid layers encode the strength of safety checking while late layers encode the verification outcome long benign cot dilutes both signals by shifting attention away from harmful tokens targeted ablations of attention heads identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal confirming their role in a safety subnetwork these results show that the most interpretable form of reasoning explicit cot can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined with finalanswer cues we release prompts outputs and judge decisions to facilitate replication artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and interpretable we advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by applying medical sparse autoencoders medsaes to the latent space of medclip a visionlanguage model trained on chest radiographs and reports to quantify interpretability we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation metrics entropy analyzes and automated neuron naming via the medgemma foundation model experiments on the chexpert dataset show that medsae neurons achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw medclip features our findings bridge highperforming medical ai and transparency offering a scalable step toward clinically reliable representations the rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment tools leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful scalable feedback conventional autograders while efficient act as blackbox systems that ply return passfail results offering little insight into student thinking or learning needs autograder is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process to a formative learning experience it introduces two key capabilities automated feedback generation using a finetuned large language model and visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns the model is finetuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure pedagogically aligned contextaware guidance in evaluation across student submissions from multiple programming tasks the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor comments for visualization contrastively learned code embeddings trained on annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters based on functionality and approach the system also supports promptpooling allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates by integrating aidriven feedback semantic clustering and interactive visualization autograder reduces instructor workload while supporting targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes the emergence of agentic artificial intelligence ai is set to trigger a cambrian explosion of new kinds of personhood this paper proposes a pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood not as a metaphysical property to be discovered but as a flexible bundle of obligations rights and responsibilities that societies confer upon entities for a variety of reasons especially to solve concrete governance problems we argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled creating bespoke solutions for different contexts this will allow for the creation of practical tools such as facilitating ai contracting by creating a target individual that can be sanctioned without needing to resolve intractable debates about an ais consciousness or rationality we explore how individuals fit in to social roles and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology examining both personhood as a problem where design choices can create dark patterns that exploit human social heuristics and personhood as a solution where conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or prevent conflict by rejecting foundationalist quests for a single essential definition of personhood this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way to think about integrating ai agents into our society the prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models llms on comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative data subsets ie tiny benchmarks that enable efficient assessment while retaining predictive fidelity current methods for this task operate under a modelcentric paradigm selecting benchmarking items based on the collective performance of existing models such approaches are limited by large upfront costs an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks coldstart and the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of their predecessors in this work we challenge this paradigm and propose a itemcentric approach to benchmark subset selection arguing that selection should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves rather than on modelspecific failure patterns we instantiate this itemcentric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method scales where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark samples empirically we show scales reduces the upfront selection cost by over while achieving competitive predictive fidelity on the open llm leaderboard using just a data subset we predict full benchmark scores with a mean absolute error we demonstrate that this itemcentric approach enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation while also providing better coldstart performance and more interpretable benchmarking artificial intelligence ai has demonstrated impressive progress in mathematical reasoning yet its integration into the practice of mathematical research remains limited in this study we investigate how the ai mathematician aim system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere problem solver focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory we analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of aim and incorporate targeted human interventions to structure the discovery process through iterative decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals selection of appropriate analytical methods and validation of intermediate results we reveal how human intuition and machine computation can complement one another this collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability transparency and interpretability of the resulting proofs while retaining human oversight for formal rigor and correctness the approach leads to a complete and verifiable proof and more broadly demonstrates how systematic humanai coreasoning can advance the frontier of mathematical discovery reinforcement finetuning rft is a key technique for aligning large language models llms with human preferences and enhancing reasoning yet its effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training uniform task sampling is inefficient wasting computation on tasks that are either trivial or unsolvable while existing task selection methods often suffer from high rollout costs poor adaptivity or incomplete evidence we introduce bots a unified framework for bayesian online task selection in llm reinforcement finetuning grounded in bayesian inference bots adaptively maintains posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves it jointly incorporates explicit evidence from direct evaluations of selected tasks and implicit evidence inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks with thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and exploitation to make implicit evidence practical we instantiate it with an ultralight interpolationbased plugin that estimates difficulties of unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts adding negligible overhead empirically across diverse domains and llm scales bots consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations providing a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in rft one approach to enhance monte carlo tree search mcts is to improve its sample efficiency by groupingabstracting states or stateaction pairs and sharing statistics within a group though stateaction pair abstractions are mostly easy to find in algorithms such as on the go abstractions in upper confidence bounds applied to trees ogauct nearly no state abstractions are found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining conditions we provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim and we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding many more abstractions we name this technique ideal pruning abstractions in uct ipauct which outperforms ogauct and any of its derivatives across a large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated ipauct uses a different abstraction framework from abstraction of stateaction pairs asap which is the one used by ogauct which we name ipa furthermore we show that both ipa and asap are special cases of a more general framework that we call pasap which itself is a special case of the asasap framework compliance at web scale poses practical challenges each request may require a regulatory assessment regulatory texts eg the general data protection regulation gdpr are crossreferential and normative while runtime contexts are expressed in unstructured natural language this setting motivates us to align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured normative elements of regulations to this end we introduce graphcompliance a framework that represents regulatory texts as a policy graph and runtime contexts as a context graph and aligns them in this formulation the policy graph encodes normative structure and crossreferences whereas the context graph formalizes events as subjectactionobject sao and entityrelation triples this alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model llm in structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation and event parsing enabling a focus on the core reasoning step in experiments on gdprderived realworld scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks graphcompliance yields percentage points pp higher microf than llmonly and rag baselines with fewer under and overpredictions resulting in higher recall and lower false positive rates ablation studies indicate contributions from each graph component suggesting that structured representations and a judge llm are complementary for normative reasoning group based reinforcement learning rl has shown impressive results on complex reasoning and mathematical tasks yet when applied to train multiturn interactive llm agents these methods often suffer from structural blindnessthe inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the environment this manifests in three critical challenges inefficient unguided exploration imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking pivotal states and myopic planning caused by static reward discounting we address these issues with graphenhanced policy optimization gepo which dynamically constructs a statetransition graph from agent experience and employs graphtheoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning signals structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward highimpact states a graphenhanced advantage function for topologyaware credit assignment and a dynamic discount factor adapted to each states strategic value on the alfworld webshop and a proprietary workbench benchmarks gepo demonstrates strong performance achieving absolute success rate gains of and over competitive baselines these results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust generalizable strategy for advancing llm agent training with increasing urban traffic complexity traffic signal control tsc is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety large language models llms emerge as promising approaches for tsc however they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles moreover diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and crossintersection training limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections therefore this paper proposes retrieval augmented generation ragenhanced distributed llm agents with emergency response for generalizable tsc regtsc firstly this paper presents an emergencyaware reasoning framework which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel reviewerbased emergency rag rerag to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents emergency decisions secondly this paper designs a typeagnostic traffic representation and proposes a rewardguided reinforced refinement for heterogeneous intersections adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedbackbased priority and finetunes llm agents with a designed rewardweighted likelihood loss guiding regtsc toward highreward policies across heterogeneous intersections on three realworld road networks with to heterogeneous intersections extensive experiments show that regtsc reduces travel time by queue length by and emergency vehicle waiting time by outperforming other stateoftheart methods millions of people take surveys every day from market polls and academic studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms these datasets capture valuable insights but their scale and structure present a unique challenge for large language models llms which otherwise excel at fewshot reasoning over openended text yet their ability to process questionnaire data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains underexplored current retrieval and survey analysis tools eg qualtrics spss redcap are typically designed for humans in the workflow limiting such data integration with llm and aiempowered automation this gap leaves scientists surveyors and everyday users without evidencebased guidance on how to best represent questionnaires for llm consumption we address this by introducing qasu questionnaire analysis and structural understanding a benchmark that probes six structural skills including answer lookup respondent count and multihop inference across six serialization formats and multiple prompt strategies experiments on contemporary llms show that choosing an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to points compared to suboptimal formats for specific tasks carefully adding a lightweight structural hint through selfaugmented prompting can yield further improvements of points on average by systematically isolating format and prompting effects our open source benchmark offers a ple yet versatile foundation for advancing both research and realworld practice in llmbased questionnaire analysis reward models rms play a critical role in aligning large language models llms with human preferences yet in the domain of tool learning the lack of rms specifically designed for functioncalling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic ai we introduce toolrm a family of lightweight generative rms tailored for general tooluse scenarios to build these models we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using rulebased scoring and multidimensional sampling this yields toolprefpairwisek a diverse balanced and challenging dataset of critique tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback to evaluate tooluse rms we also introduce trbenchbfcl a benchmark built on the agentic evaluation suite bfcl trained on our constructed data models from the qwenbb series achieve up to higher accuracy substantially outperforming frontier models such as claude and openai in pairwise reward judgments beyond training objectives toolrm generalizes to broader critique tasks including bestofn sampling and selfcorrection experiments on acebench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency enabling inferencetime scaling and reducing output token usage by over we release data and model checkpoints to facilitate future research large language models llms are catalyzing the development of autonomous ai research agents for scientific and engineering discovery we present fm agent a novel and generalpurpose multiagent framework that leverages a synergistic combination of llmbased reasoning and largescale evolutionary search to address complex realworld challenges the core of fm agent integrates several key innovations a coldstart initialization phase incorporating expert guidance a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization domainspecific evaluators that combine correctness effectiveness and llmsupervised

enterprise rd workflows and fundamental scientific research where it can accelerate innovation automate complex discovery processes and deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal impact reinforcement learning rl can elicit strong reasoning in large language models llms yet most open efforts focus on math and code we propose reasoning curriculum a ple twostage curriculum that first elicits reasoning skills in pretrainingaligned domains such as math then adapts and refines these skills across other domains via joint rl stage performs a brief cold start and then mathonly rl with verifiable rewards to develop reasoning skills stage runs joint rl on mixeddomain data to transfer and consolidate these skills the curriculum is minimal and backboneagnostic requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks evaluated on qwenb and llamab over a multidomain suite reasoning curriculum yields consistent gains ablations and a cognitiveskill analysis indicate that both stages are necessary and that mathfirst elicitation increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems reasoning curriculum provides a compact easytoadopt recipe for general reasoning the inference cost of large language models llms has become a critical factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption this paper introduces a quantitative economics of inference framework treating the llm inference process as a computedriven intelligent production activity we analyze its marginal cost economies of scale and quality of output under various performance configurations based on empirical data from wineval we construct the first llm inference production frontier revealing three principles diminishing marginal cost diminishing returns to scale and an optimal costeffectiveness zone this paper not only provides an economic basis for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the future marketbased pricing and optimization of ai inference resources large vision language models vlms have advanced graphical user interface gui task automation but still lag behind humans we hypothesize this gap stems from missing core gui knowledge which existing training schemes such as supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning alone cannot fully address by analyzing common failure patterns in gui task execution we distill gui knowledge into three dimensions interface perception knowledge about recognizing widgets and system states interaction prediction knowledge about reasoning action state transitions and instruction understanding knowledge about planning verifying and assessing task completion progress we further introduce gui knowledge bench a benchmark with multiple choice and yesno questions across six platforms web android macos windows linux ios and applications our evaluation shows that current vlms identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states predicting actions and verifying task completion experiments on real world gui tasks further validate the close link between gui knowledge and task success by providing a structured framework for assessing gui knowledge our work supports the selection of vlms with greater potential prior to downstream training and provides insights for building more capable gui agents we present leanphys a comprehensive reasoning framework for collegelevel physics problems in lean leanphys includes leanphysbench a collegelevel benchmark for formal physics reasoning in lean which contains handcrafted and peerreviewed statements derived from university textbooks and physics competition problems to establish a solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics we also introduce physlib a communitydriven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems essential for formal physics reasoning based on the benchmark and lean repository we composed in leanphys we report baseline results using major expert math lean provers and stateoftheart closedsource models with the best performance of deepseekprovervb achieving only and claudesonnet achieving we also conduct a detailed analysis showing that our physlib can achieve an average improvement of in model performance this demonstrates the challenging nature of our leanphysbench and the effectiveness of physlib to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to provide a physics benchmark in lean the ai we use is powerful and its power is increasing rapidly if this powerful ai is to serve the needs of consumers voters and decision makers then it is imperative that the ai is accountable in general an agent is accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent about its actions if the forum and the agent can discuss this information and if the forum can sanction the agent unfortunately in too many cases todays ai is not accountable we cannot question it enter into a discussion with it let alone sanction it in this chapter we relate the general definition of accountability to ai we illustrate what it means for ai to be accountable and unaccountable and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living in a world where all ai is accountable to those who are affected by it despite significant advancements in recent decades autonomous vehicles avs continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human drivers excel in such situations avs often become immobilized disrupting overall traffic flow current recovery solutions such as remote intervention which is costly and inefficient and manual takeover which excludes nondrivers and limits av accessibility are inadequate this paper introduces stucksolver a novel large language model llm driven recovery framework that enables avs to resolve immobilization scenarios through selfreasoning andor passengerguided decisionmaking stucksolver is designed as a plugin addon module that operates on top of the avs existing perceptionplanningcontrol stack requiring no modification to its internal architecture instead it interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states interpret environmental context and generate highlevel recovery commands that can be executed by the avs native planner we evaluate stucksolver on the benchdrive benchmark and in customdesigned uncertainty scenarios results show that stucksolver achieves nearstateoftheart performance through autonomous selfreasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when passenger guidance is incorporated the rapid growth of research literature particularly in large language models llms has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers increasingly difficult this paper introduces autosurvey a multistage pipeline that automates survey generation through retrievalaugmented synthesis and structured evaluation the system integrates parallel section generation iterative refinement and realtime retrieval of recent publications to ensure both topical completeness and factual accuracy quality is assessed using a multillm evaluation framework that measures coverage structure and relevance in alignment with expert review standards experimental results demonstrate that autosurvey consistently outperforms existing retrievalbased and automated baselines achieving higher scores in structural coherence and topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity by combining retrieval reasoning and automated evaluation into a unified framework autosurvey

supporting users who lack sql expertise detailed schema knowledge or prompting skill we conclude that agentic orchestration rather than stronger sql generators alone is a promising foundation for interactive geospatial assistants peoples goaldirected behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this for example peoples attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving to work here building on recent work in computational cognitive science we formally articulate the attentionaware inverse planning problem in which the goal is to estimate a persons attentional biases from their actions we demonstrate how attentionaware inverse planning systematically differs from standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be inferred from behavior finally we present an approach to attentionaware inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling we use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of rl agents in reallife driving scenarios selected from the waymo open dataset demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with attentionaware inverse planning we introduce humansjunior a model that matches gpto on the facts grounding

across engineering finance and business teams finops practitioners face a fundamental challenge billing data arrives in heterogeneous formats taxonomies and metrics from multiple cloud providers and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights and making timesensitive decisions to address this challenge we propose leveraging autonomous goaldriven ai agents for finops automation in this paper we built a finops agent for a typical usecase for it infrastructure and cost optimization we built a system ulating a realistic endtoend industry process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization we defined a set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several opensource and closesource language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand plan and execute tasks as well as an actual finops practitioner large language models llms have demonstrated transformative potential in scientific research yet their deployment in highstakes contexts raises significant trustworthiness concerns here we introduce scitrust a comprehensive framework for evaluating llm trustworthiness in scientific applications across four dimensions truthfulness adversarial robustness scientific safety and scientific ethics our framework incorporates novel openended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified reflectiontuning pipeline and expert validation alongside a novel ethics benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories including dualuse research and bias we evaluated seven prominent llms including four sciencespecialized models and three generalpurpose industry models using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy semantic ilarity measures and llmbased scoring generalpurpose industry models overall outperformed sciencespecialized models across each trustworthiness dimension with gptomini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness assessments and adversarial robustness sciencespecialized models showed significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities along with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations particularly in highrisk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons by opensourcing our framework we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy ai systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific contexts aligning llmbased judges with human preferences is a significant challenge as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity bias and instability overcoming this challenge advances key applications such as creating reliable reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf and building effective routing systems that select the bestsuited model for a given user query in this work we propose a framework for modeling diverse personabased preferences by learning to aggregate outputs from multiple rubricconditioned judges we investigate the performance of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case studies on both human and llmjudges biases our primary contributions include a personabased method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two distinct implementations of our aggregator generalized additive model gam and a multilayer perceptron mlp existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal structure rather than superficial statistical patterns we introduce a twolevel framework to address this gap the informationtheoretic imperative iti establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression this is the evolutionary why linking survival pressure to informationprocessing demands the compression efficiency principle cep specifies how efficient compression mechanically selects for generative causal models through exceptionaccumulation dynamics making reality alignment a consequence rather than a contingent achievement together iti and cep define a causal chain from survival pressure to prediction necessity compression requirement efficiency optimization generative structure discovery and ultimately reality alignment each link follows from physical informationtheoretic or evolutionary constraints implying that intelligence is the mechanically necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments this framework yields empirically testable predictions compression efficiency measured as approach to the ratedistortion frontier correlates with outofdistribution generalization exceptionaccumulation rates differentiate causal from correlational models hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across abstraction layers and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that track representational complexity iti and cep thereby provide a unified account of convergence across biological artificial and multiscale systems addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience large language models llms are increasingly used as raters for evaluation tasks however their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks when human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels thinking traces the reasoning behind a judgment are highly informative but challenging to collect and curate we present a humanllm collaborative framework to infer thinking traces from labelonly annotations the proposed framework uses a ple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at scale these inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks finetuning open llm raters and synthesizing clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary llm raters across multiple datasets our methods lead to significantly improved llmhuman agreement additionally the refined annotation guidelines increase agreement among different llm models these results suggest that llms can serve as practical proxies for otherwise unrevealed human thinking traces enabling labelonly corpora to be extended into thinkingtraceaugmented resources that enhance the reliability of llm raters large language models llms promise to transform interactive games by enabling nonplayer characters npcs to sustain unscripted dialogue yet it remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience we investigate this question through the interview a voicebased detective game powered by gpto a withinsubjects usability study compared highconstraint hcp and lowconstraint lcp prompts revealing no reliable experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns guided by these findings we redesigned the hcp into a hybrid jsonrag scaffold and conducted a synthetic evaluation with an llm judge positioned as an earlystage complement to usability testing results uncovered a novel pattern scaffolding effects were roledependent the interviewer questgiver npc gained stability while suspect npcs lost improvisational believability these findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance play extending fuzzysymbolic scaffolding we introduce symbolically scaffolded play a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as fuzzy numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement we present a novel framework for industry that plifies the deployment of ai models on edge devices in various industrial settings the design reduces latency and avoids external data transfer by enabling local inference and realtime processing our implementation is agentbased which means that individual agents whether human algorithmic or collaborative are responsible for welldefined tasks enabling flexibility and plifying integration moreover our framework supports modular integration and maintains low resource requirements preliminary evaluations concerning the food industry in real scenarios indicate improved deployment time and system adaptability performance the source code is publicly available at contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations typically expressed as centipawn scores while effective for decisionmaking these outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns in this paper we explore adapting shap shapley additive explanations to the domain of chess analysis aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to specific pieces on the board by treating pieces as features and systematically ablating them we compute additive perpiece contributions that explain the engines output in a locally faithful and humaninterpretable manner this method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy where players assess positions by mentally removing pieces and grounds it in modern explainable ai techniques our approach opens new possibilities for visualization human training and engine comparison we release accompanying code and data to foster future research in interpretable chess ai recent video generation models can produce highfidelity temporally coherent videos indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge beyond realistic synthesis they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception modeling and manipulation yet an important question still remains are video models ready to serve as zeroshot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios in this work we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question focusing on the leading and popular veo we evaluate its reasoning behavior across dimensions including spatial geometric physical temporal and embodied logic systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes to standardize this study we curate the evaluation data into mmecof a compact benchmark that enables indepth and thorough assessment of chainofframe cof reasoning our findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on shorthorizon spatial coherence finegrained grounding and locally consistent dynamics they remain limited in longhorizon causal reasoning strict geometric constraints and abstract logic overall they are not yet reliable as standalone zeroshot reasoners but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models project page as coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases the need to automatically design challenging codebaselevel evaluation is central we propose gistify a task where a coding llm must create a single minimal selfcontained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase the coding llm is given full access to a codebase along with a specific entrypoint eg a python command and the generated file must replicate the output of the same command ran under the full codebase while containing only the essential components necessary to execute the provided command success on gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase accurate modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially large code patches our findings show that current stateoftheart models struggle to reliably solve gistify tasks especially ones with long executions traces reinforcement learning rl finetuning of large language models llms often suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and inference policies while prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments we show that its root cause lies in the floating point precision itself the widely adopted bf despite its large dynamic range introduces large rounding errors that breaks the consistency between training and inference in this work we demonstrate that ply reverting to fp effectively eliminates this mismatch the change is ple fully supported by modern frameworks with only a few lines of code change and requires no modification to the model architecture or learning algorithm our results suggest that using fp uniformly yields more stable optimization faster convergence and stronger performance across diverse tasks algorithms and frameworks we hope these findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision tradeoffs in rl finetuning ais have made rapid progress on researchoriented benchmarks of knowledge and reasoning but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value and automation to measure this we introduce the remote labor index rli a broadly multisector benchmark comprising realworld economically valuable projects designed to evaluate endtoend agent performance in practical settings ai agents perform near the floor on rli with the highestperforming agent achieving an automation rate of these results help ground discussions of ai automation in empirical evidence setting a common basis for tracking ai impacts and enabling stakeholders to proactively navigate aidriven labor automation a world model is an internal model that ulates how the world evolves given past observations and actions it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think plan and reason effectively in complex dynamic settings despite rapid progress current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons we argue that a central cause is representation quality exteroceptive inputs eg images are highdimensional and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard we therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve worldmodel performance in this work we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic world we propose geometricallyregularized world models grwm which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space this approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment grwm is plugandplay requires only minimal architectural modification scales with trajectory length and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones across deterministic settings and longhorizon prediction tasks grwm significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure these findings support a clear takeaway improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models delivering reliable longhorizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module we present amobench an advanced mathematical reasoning benchmark with olympiad level or even higher difficulty comprising humancrafted problems existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models llms however many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing toptier llms due to performance saturation eg aime to address this amobench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all problems are crossvalidated by experts to meet at least the international mathematical olympiad imo difficulty standards and entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization moreover each problem in amobench requires only a final answer rather than a proof enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation experimental results across llms on amobench show that even the bestperforming model achieves only accuracy on amobench with most llms scoring below beyond these poor performances our further analysis reveals a promising scaling trend with increasing testtime compute on amobench these results highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in current llms we release amobench to facilitate further research into advancing the reasoning abilities of language models as llms occupy an increasingly important role in society they are more and more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems therefore studying the alignment of llms with human values has become a crucial field of inquiry prior work however mostly focuses on evaluating the alignment of fully trained models overlooking the training dynamics by which models learn to express human values in this work we investigate how and at which stage value alignment arises during the course of a models posttraining our analysis disentangles the effects of posttraining algorithms and datasets measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts during training experimenting with llama and qwen models of different sizes and popular supervised finetuning sft and preference optimization datasets and algorithms we find that the sft phase generally establishes a models values and subsequent preference optimization rarely realigns these values furthermore using a synthetic preference dataset that enables controlled manipulation of values we find that different preference optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes even when preference data is held constant our findings provide actionable insights into how values are learned during posttraining and help to inform data curation as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization to improve model alignment to human values the endtoend label for llms is a misnomer in practice they depend on a nondifferentiable decoding process that requires laborious handtuning of hyperparameters like temperature and topp this paper introduces autodeco a novel architecture that enables truly endtoend generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy we augment the standard transformer with lightweight heads that at each step dynamically predict contextspecific temperature and topp values alongside the nexttoken logits this approach transforms decoding into a parametric tokenlevel process allowing the model to selfregulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks we demonstrate that autodeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracletuned baseline derived from hacking the test seta practical upper bound for any static method crucially we uncover an emergent capability for instructionbased decoding control the model learns to interpret natural language commands eg generate with low randomness and adjusts its predicted temperature and topp on a tokenbytoken basis opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive llm decoding we introduce kimi linear a hybrid linear attention architecture that for the first time outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across various scenarios including shortcontext longcontext and reinforcement learning rl scaling regimes at its core lies kimi delta attention kda an expressive linear attention module that extends gated deltanet with a finergrained gating mechanism enabling more effective use of limited finitestate rnn memory our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware efficiency through a specialized variant of the diagonalpluslowrank dplr transition matrices which substantially reduces computation compared to the general dplr formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical delta rule we pretrain a kimi linear model with activated parameters and total parameters based on a layerwise hybrid of kda and multihead latent attention mla our experiments show that with an identical training recipe kimi linear outperforms full mla with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks while reducing kv cache usage by up to and achieving up to times decoding throughput for a context these results demonstrate that kimi linear can be a dropin replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency including tasks with longer input and output lengths to support further research we opensource the kda kernel and vllm implementations and release the pretrained and instructiontuned model checkpoints large language models llms have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across multiple domains by leveraging massive pretraining and curated finetuning data however in datasensitive fields such as healthcare the lack of highquality domainspecific training corpus hinders llms adaptation for specialized applications meanwhile domain experts have distilled domain wisdom into ontology rules which formalize relationships among concepts and ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories viewing llms as implicit repositories of human knowledge we propose evontree a novel framework that leverages a small set of highquality ontology rules to systematically extract validate and enhance domain knowledge within llms without requiring extensive external datasets specifically evontree extracts domain ontology from raw models detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules and reinforces the refined knowledge via selfdistilled finetuning extensive experiments on medical qa benchmarks with llamabinstruct and medv demonstrate consistent outperformance over both unmodified models and leading supervised baselines achieving up to a improvement in accuracy these results confirm the effectiveness efficiency and robustness of our approach for lowresource domain adaptation of llms recent large language model llm research has undergone an architectural shift from encoderdecoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoderonly modeling this rapid transition however comes without a rigorous comparative analysis especially from the scaling perspective raising concerns that the potential of encoderdecoder models may have been overlooked to fill this gap we revisit encoderdecoder llm redllm enhancing it with recent recipes from decoderonly llm decllm we conduct a comprehensive comparison between redllm pretrained with prefix language modeling lm and decllm pretrained with causal lm at different model scales ranging from simm to simb using redpajama tokens for pretraining and flan for instruction tuning our experiments show that redllm produces compelling scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance while decllm is overall more computeoptimal during pretraining redllm demonstrates comparable scaling and context length extrapolation capabilities after instruction tuning redllm achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while enjoying substantially better inference efficiency we hope our findings could inspire more efforts on reexamining redllm unlocking its potential for developing powerful and efficient llms multipage visual documents such as manuals brochures presentations and posters convey key information through layout colors icons and crossslide references while large language models llms offer opportunities in document understanding current systems struggle with complex multipage visual documents particularly in finegrained reasoning over elements and pages we introduce slideagent a versatile agentic framework for understanding multimodal multipage and multilayout documents especially slide decks slideagent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three specialized levelsglobal page and elementto construct a structured queryagnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and detailed visual or textual cues during inference slideagent selectively activates specialized agents for multilevel reasoning and integrates their outputs into coherent contextaware answers extensive experiments show that slideagent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary overall and opensource models overall large language models llms face significant inference latency challenges stemming from their autoregressive design and large size to address this speculative decoding emerges as a solution enabling the ultaneous generation and validation of multiple tokens while recent approaches like eagle and eagle improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as gpu devices and batch sizes therefore we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called cast that takes into account inference costs including factors such as gpu configurations and batch sizes to dynamically refine the tree structure through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing six distinct llms our methodology demonstrates remarkable results achieving speeds up to times faster than conventional decoding methods moreover it generally outperforms existing stateoftheart techniques from to reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards rlvr is a promising approach for enhancing agentic deep search however its application is often hindered by low reward density in deep search scenarios where agents expend significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards in this paper we formalize this challenge as the reward density optimization problem which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of exploration cost this paper introduce infoflow a systematic framework that tackles this problem from three aspects subproblem decomposition breaking down longrange tasks to assign process rewards thereby providing denser learning signals failureguided hints injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the probability of successful outcomes dualagent refinement employing a dualagent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep exploration a refiner agent synthesizes the search history which effectively compresses the researchers perceived trajectory thereby reducing exploration cost and increasing the overall reward density we evaluate infoflow on multiple agentic search benchmarks where it significantly outperforms strong baselines enabling lightweight llms to achieve performance comparable to advanced proprietary llms this paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in hernandez et al that decode specific relational facts in transformer language models we extend their singlerelation findings to a collection of relations and systematically chart their organization we show that such collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by ple order tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy to explain this surprising redundancy we develop a crossevaluation protocol in which we apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation our results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations but extract recurring coarsegrained semantic properties eg country of capital city and country of food are both in the countryofx property this propertycentric structure clarifies both the operators compressibility and highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically close our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer language models as primarily propertybased rather than relationspecific diacritics restoration in hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning despite the languages high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized recent machine learning approaches have significantly advanced performance on this task in this work we present divrit a novel system for hebrew diacritization that frames the task as a zeroshot classification problem our approach operates at the word level selecting the most appropriate diacritization pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set conditioned on the surrounding textual context a key innovation of divrit is its use of a hebrew visual language model which processes undiacritized text as an image allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the inputs vector representation through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations we demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying on complex explicit linguistic analysis notably in an oracle setting where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided candidates divrit achieves a high level of accuracy furthermore strategic architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield significant improvements in the systems overall generalization capabilities these findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for accurate and automated hebrew diacritization human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured lexically dense and filled with ambiguous or shifting references which pose significant challenges for automated knowledge graph kg construction while recent llmbased approaches improve over static templates they still generate noisy fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided extraction and coreference resolution the recently proposed corekg framework addresses these limitations by integrating a typeaware coreference module and domainguided structured prompts significantly reducing node duplication and legal noise in this work we present a systematic ablation study of corekg to quantify the individual contributions of its two key components our results show that removing coreference resolution results in a increase in node duplication and a increase in noisy nodes while removing structured prompts leads to a increase in node duplication and a increase in noisy nodes these findings offer empirical insights for designing robust llmbased pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex legal texts purpose the purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of multiple llm agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable assessment of a pixelbased ai triage tool than a single llm methods noncontrast ct head exams from fourteen hospitals were processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage ich ai detection tool radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight opensource llm models and a hipaa compliant internal version of gpto using a single multishot prompt that assessed for presence of ich examples were manually reviewed performance characteristics of the eight opensource models and consensus were compared to gpto three ideal consensus llm ensembles were tested for rating the performance of the triage tool results the cohort consisted of head cts examreport pairs the highest auc performance was achieved with llamab and gpto auc the average precision was highest for llamab and gpto ap llamab had the highest score and recall greater precision specificity and mcc using mcc ci the ideal combination of llms were full ensemble top ensemble consensus and gpto no statistically significant differences were observed between top full and consensus conclusion an ensemble of medium to large sized opensource llms provides a more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective evaluation of a clinical ai triage tool over a single llm alone large language models llms continue to advance with an increasing number of domainspecific variants tailored for specialised tasks however these models often lack transparency and explainability can be costly to finetune require substantial prompt engineering yield inconsistent results across domains and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high computational demands to address these challenges we propose the bayesian network llm fusion bnlf framework which integrates predictions from three llms including finbert roberta and bertweet through a probabilistic mechanism for sentiment analysis bnlf performs late fusion by modelling the sentiment predictions from multiple llms as probabilistic nodes within a bayesian network evaluated across three humanannotated financial corpora with distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics bnlf demonstrates consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline llms underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification large language models llms have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in language comprehension and generation however their widespread adoption is constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands while pruning and lowrank imation have each demonstrated promising performance individually their synergy for llms remains underexplored we introduce underlinesynergistic underlinesparse and underlinelowrank underlinecompression sslc methods for llms which leverages the strengths of both techniques lowrank imation compresses the model by retaining its essential structure with minimal information loss whereas sparse optimization eliminates nonessential weights preserving those crucial for generalization based on theoretical analysis we first formulate the lowrank imation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by iterative optimization algorithm experiments on llama and qwen models bb show that sslc without any additional training steps consistently surpasses standalone methods achieving stateofthearts results notably sslc compresses qwen by with no performance drop and achieves at least times speedup offering a practical solution for efficient llm deployment with the rapid development of large language models llms various llmbased works have been widely applied in educational fields however most existing llms and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension largely neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for realworld educational scenarios additionally current benchmarks are often limited to a single subject or question type lacking sufficient diversity this issue is particularly prominent within the chinese context to address this gap we introduce omniedubench a comprehensive chinese educational benchmark omniedubench consists of highquality questionanswer pairs the data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions the knowledge dimension and the cultivation dimension which contain and entries respectively each dimension is further subdivided into finegrained categories covering a total of different subjects in the knowledge and in the cultivation furthermore the dataset features a rich variety of question formats including common exam question types providing a solid foundation for comprehensively evaluating llms capabilities in education extensive experiments on mainstream opensource and closedsource llms reveal a clear performance gap in the knowledge dimension only gemini pro surpassed accuracy while in the cultivation dimension the bestperforming model qwq still trailed human intelligence by nearly these results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the challenges of applying llms in education with the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence ai methods to support science workflows we are interested in the use of discourselevel information to find supporting evidence for ai generated scientific claims a first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse structure in scientific writing in this work we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language model plm and large language model llm approaches for discourse relation classification drc focusing on scientific publications an understudied genre for this task we examine how context can help with the drc task with our experiments showing that context as defined by discourse structure is generally helpful we also present an analysis of which scientific discourse relation types might benefit most from context while a multiagent approach based on large language models llms represents a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models its success is critically dependent on synergistic team composition however forming optimal teams is a significant challenge as the inherent opacity of most models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective collaboration in this paper we propose an interactioncentric framework for automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including their internal architectures training data or task performances our method constructs a language model graph that maps relationships between models from the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations and then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters our experiments with diverse llms demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent groups that reflect their latent specializations priming conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of manuallycurated teams based on known model specializations our findings provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multiagent llm teams healthrelated misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful it is difficult to identify especially when claims distort or misinterpret scientific findings we investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and lightweight finetuning techniques on the ability of large language models llms to recognize fallacious arguments using the missci dataset and framework in this work we propose missynth a pipeline that applies retrievalaugmented generation rag to produce synthetic fallacy samples which are then used to finetune an llm model our results show substantial accuracy gains with finetuned models compared to vanilla baselines for instance the llama finetuned model achieved an over fscore absolute improvement on the missci test split over its vanilla baseline we demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited annotated resources can significantly enhance zeroshot llm classification performance on realworld scientific misinformation tasks even with limited computational resources the code and synthetic dataset are available on large language models llms excel at general tasks but underperform in specialized domains like economics and psychology which require deep principled understanding to address this we introduce acer automated curriculumenhanced regimen that transforms generalist models into domain experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities acer first synthesizes a comprehensive textbookstyle curriculum by generating a table of contents for a subject and then creating questionanswer qa pairs guided by blooms taxonomy this ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing difficulty the resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining with an interleaved curriculum schedule aligning learning across both content and cognitive dimensions experiments with llama and show significant gains in specialized mmlu subsets in challenging domains like microeconomics where baselines struggle acer boosts accuracy by percentage points across all target domains we observe a consistent macroaverage improvement of percentage points notably acer not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also facilitates positive crossdomain knowledge transfer improving performance on nontarget domains by points beyond mmlu acer enhances performance on knowledgeintensive benchmarks like arc and gpqa by over absolute points while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks our results demonstrate that acer offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing critical domain gaps in llms language models can be used to provide interactive personalized student feedback in educational settings however realworld deployment faces three key challenges privacy concerns limited computational resources and the need for pedagogically valid responses these constraints require small opensource models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct information we introduce scribe a framework for multihop toolaugmented reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about feedback reports scribe combines domainspecific tools with a selfreflective inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning tool use and error recovery we distil these capabilities into and models via twostage lora finetuning on synthetic gptogenerated data evaluation with a humanaligned gptjudge and a user study with students shows that bscribe models achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions such as relevance and actionability while being perceived on par with gpto and llama by students these findings demonstrate the viability of scribe for lowresource privacysensitive educational applications openais chatgpt atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction enabling the model to analyze webpages process user intents and execute cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser while its capacity for information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated its performance in dynamic interactive environments remains less explored in this study we conduct an early evaluation of atlass web interaction capabilities using browserbased games as test scenarios including googles trex runner sudoku flappy bird and we employ ingame performance scores as quantitative metrics to assess performance across different task types our results show that atlas performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like sudoku completing puzzles significantly faster than human baselines but struggles substantially in realtime games requiring precise timing and motor control often failing to progress beyond initial obstacles these findings suggest that while atlas demonstrates capable analytical processing there remain notable limitations in dynamic web environments requiring realtime interaction the website of our project can be found at recent work has shown that different large language models llms converge to ilar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers these findings conflict with the documented propensity of llms to produce erroneous outputs when dealing with numeric information in this work we aim to explain this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms we find that despite surfacing errors different language models learn interchangeable representations of numbers that are systematic highly accurate and universal across their hidden states and the types of input contexts this allows us to create universal probes for each llm and to trace information including the causes of output errors to specific layers our results lay a fundamental understanding of how pretrained llms manipulate numbers and outline the potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of llms architectures large language models llms commonly boost reasoning via sampleevaluateensemble decoders achieving label free gains without ground truth however prevailing strategies score candidates using only external outputs such as token probabilities entropies or self evaluations and these signals can be poorly calibrated after post training we instead analyze internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than incorrect ones throughout generation and activations from correct responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement whereas incorrect ones diverge motivated by these observations we propose neuron agreement decoding nad an unsupervised bestofn method that selects candidates using activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement operating solely on internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs nad enables early correctness prediction within the first generated tokens and supports aggressive early stopping across math and science benchmarks with verifiable answers nad matches majority voting on open ended coding benchmarks where majority voting is inapplicable nad consistently outperforms avg by pruning unpromising trajectories early nad reduces token usage by with minimal loss in generation quality showing that internal signals provide reliable scalable and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding visionlanguage models vlms exhibit uneven performance across languages a problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced while knowledge distillation kd demonstrates promising results in transferring knowledge from larger to smaller vlms applying kd in multilingualism is an underexplored area this paper presents a controlled empirical study of kd behavior across five distillation approaches isolating their effects on crosslingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability under model compression we study five distillation formulations across clip and siglip and evaluate them on indomain retrieval and outofdomain visual qa we find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual retrieval robustness despite halving model size but others fail to maintain crosstask stability exposing designsensitive tradeoffs that aggregate accuracy alone does not reveal throughout language history words are borrowed from one language to another and gradually become integrated into the recipients lexicon speakers can often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary particularly in bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical items on a minority language this paper investigates whether pretrained language models including large language models possess ilar capabilities for loanword identification we evaluate multiple models across languages despite explicit instructions and contextual information our results show that models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones these findings corroborate previous evidence that modern nlp systems exhibit a bias toward loanwords rather than native equivalents our work has implications for developing nlp tools for minority languages and supporting language preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages the ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in human communication and language use and language models are also expected to possess this capability this study demonstrates that providing language models with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective incontext learning approach for tasks to understand implied meanings specifically we propose an approach in which an overview of pragmatic theories such as gricean pragmatics and relevance theory is presented as a prompt to the language model guiding it through a stepbystep reasoning process to derive a final interpretation experimental results showed that compared to the baseline which prompts intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories shot chainofthought our methods enabled language models to achieve up to higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks furthermore we show that even without explaining the details of pragmatic theories merely mentioning their names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement around in larger models compared to the baseline retrievalaugmented generation rag has emerged as a leading approach to reducing hallucinations in large language models llms current rag evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local rag retrieving relevant chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only localized understanding within specific text chunks however many realworld applications require a fundamentally different capability global rag which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document collections to derive corpuslevel insights for example what are the top most cited papers in in this paper we introduce globalqa the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global rag capabilities covering four core task types counting extremum queries sorting and topk extraction through systematic evaluation across different models and baselines we find that existing rag methods perform poorly on global tasks with the strongest baseline achieving only score to address these challenges we propose globalrag a multitool collaborative framework that preserves structural coherence through chunklevel retrieval incorporates llmdriven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents and integrates aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation on the qwenb model globalrag achieves compared to the strongest baselines validating the effectiveness of our method human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable ways as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data encodes while prior work studies preferences over certain attributes eg length or sycophancy automatically extracting relevant features without prespecifying hypotheses remains challenging we introduce whats in my human feedback wimhf a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders wimhf characterizes both the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring and the preferences that the annotators actually express across datasets wimhf identifies a small number of humaninterpretable features that account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by blackbox models these features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer and the role of datasetlevel context for example users on reddit prefer informality and jokes while annotators in hhrlhf and prism disprefer them wimhf also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences such as that lmarena users tend to vote against refusals often in favor of toxic content the learned features enable effective data curation relabeling the harmful examples in arena yields large safety gains with no cost to general performance they also allow finegrained personalization on the community alignment dataset we learn annotatorspecific weights over subjective features that improve preference prediction wimhf provides a humancentered analysis method for practitioners to better understand and use preference data while diffusion language models dlms enable finegrained refinement their practical controllability remains fragile we identify and formally characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting in which uniform and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement process thereby degrading fluency and coherence as this failure originates in uniform and context agnostic updates effective control demands explicit token ordering we propose token timestep allocation tta which realizes soft and semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules critical tokens are frozen early while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement this timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an adaptive policy driven by task signals thereby supporting a broad spectrum of refinement strategies because it operates purely at inference time it applies uniformly across various dlms and naturally extends to diverse supervision sources empirically tta improves controllability and fluency on sentiment control it yields more than percent higher accuracy and nearly halves perplexity using less than one fifth the steps in detoxification it lowers maximum toxicity versus and perplexity versus together these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable and controllable diffusion text generation current llm evaluations often rely on a single instruction template overlooking models sensitivity to instruction stylea critical aspect for realworld deployments we present rcscore a multidimensional framework quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses by systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction styles rcscore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional metrics our experiments across ten llms on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to points we introduce crossresponse ilarity crs a method applying rcscore metrics to measure stylistic selfconsistency and establish its strong correlation with task accuracy suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model reliability additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more stylistically stable outputs and model scale correlates positively with crossstyle consistency rcscore offers a principled approach to assess instruction robustness we introduce ilaritydistancemagnitude sdm language models lms which are sequence prediction models finetuned to maximize the proportion of generations in the wellcalibrated highprobability region partitioned by a finallayer sdm activation layer used for binary classification of instructionfollowing we demonstrate that existing pretrained decoderonly transformer lms can be readily converted into sdm lms via supervised finetuning using the finallayer sdm activation layer during training to estimate a changeofbase for a supervised nexttoken loss over a contrastive input encoding scheme with additional hard negative examples generated online during training this results in reduced abstentions ie improved statistical efficiency compared to strong supervised baselines large language models llms have significantly advanced generative applications in natural language processing nlp recent trends in model architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or statespacegatedrecurrent models ssms grms however prevailing ssmgrmbased methods often emulate only a single attention head potentially limiting their expressiveness in this work we propose mossnet a novel mixtureofstatespaceexperts architecture that emulates a linear multihead attention mha mossnet leverages a mixtureofexperts moe implementation not only in channelmixing multilayered perceptron mlp blocks but also in the timemixing ssm kernels to realize multiple attention heads extensive experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that mossnet outperforms both transformer and ssmbased architectures of ilar model size and data budgets larger variants of mossnet trained on trillions of tokens further confirm its scalability and superior performance in addition realdevice profiling on a samsung galaxy ultra and an nvidia a gpu demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to ilarly sized baselines our results suggest that mossnet is a compelling new direction for efficient highperforming recurrent llm architectures this paper investigates the relationship between persuasion techniques pts and discourse relations drs by leveraging large language models llms and prompt engineering since no dataset annotated with both pts and drs exists we took the semeval task dataset labelled with pts as a starting point and developed llmbased classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with one of the pdtb level drs in total four llms were evaluated using different prompts resulting in unique dr classifiers ensemble models using different majoritypooling strategies were used to create silver datasets of instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level pdtb senses the silver dataset sizes vary from instances to instances depending on the majority pooling technique used statistical analysis of these silver datasets shows that six discourse relations namely cause purpose contrast causebelief concession and condition play a crucial role in persuasive texts especially in the use of loaded language exaggerationminimisation repetition and to cast doubt this insight can contribute to detecting online propaganda and misinformation as well as to our general understanding of effective communication while testtime scaling tts has proven effective in improving the reasoning ability of large language models llms low diversity in model outputs often becomes a bottleneck this is partly caused by the common one problem one solution ps training practice which provides a single canonical answer and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths to address this we propose a one problem multiple solutions pns training paradigm that exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus increases inference diversity a core challenge for pns is reliably measuring semantic differences between multistep chains of thought so we introduce reasoning path divergence rpd a steplevel metric that aligns and scores long chainofthought solutions to capture differences in intermediate reasoning using rpd we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and finetune qwenbbase experiments show that rpdselected training yields more varied outputs and higher passk with an average gain in pass over a strong ps baseline and a gain on aime demonstrating that pns further amplifies the effectiveness of tts our code is available at large language models llms have increasingly been applied to automatic programming code generation this task can be viewed as a language generation task that bridges natural language human knowledge and programming logic however it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with hardware devices such as quantum programming where human coders write python code that is executed on a quantum computer to address this gap we introduce qcoder benchmark an evaluation framework that assesses llms on quantum programming with feedback from ulated hardware devices our benchmark offers two key features first it supports evaluation using a quantum ulator environment beyond conventional python execution allowing feedback of domainspecific metrics such as circuit depth execution time and error classification which can be used to guide better generation second it incorporates humanwritten code submissions collected from real programming contests enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of llm outputs against humanwritten codes our experiments reveal that even advanced models like gpto achieve only around accuracy highlighting the difficulty of the benchmark in contrast reasoningbased models such as reach up to accuracy outperforming averaged success rates of humanwritten codes we release the qcoder benchmark dataset and public evaluation api to support further research importance incidental thyroid findings itfs are increasingly detected on imaging performed for nonthyroid indications their prevalence features and clinical consequences remain undefined objective to develop validate and deploy a natural language processing nlp pipeline to identify itfs in radiology reports and assess their prevalence features and clinical outcomes design setting and participants retrospective cohort of adults without prior thyroid disease undergoing thyroidcapturing imaging at mayo clinic sites from july to september a transformerbased nlp pipeline identified itfs and

diagnosis biopsy thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis most cancers were papillary and larger when detected after itfs vs no itf conclusions itfs were common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small lowrisk cancers these findings underscore the role of itfs in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective followup crosslingual alignment cla aims to align multilingual representations enabling large language models llms to seamlessly transfer knowledge across languages while intuitive we hypothesize this pursuit of representational convergence can inadvertently cause cultural erasure the functional loss of providing culturallysituated responses that should diverge based on the query language in this work we systematically analyze this tradeoff by introducing a holistic evaluation framework the transferlocalization plane which quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure using this framework we reevaluate recent cla approaches and find that they consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural localization across all six languages studied our investigation into the internal representations of these models reveals a key insight universal factual transfer and culturallyspecific knowledge are optimally steerable at different model layers based on this finding we propose surgical steering a novel inferencetime method that disentangles these two objectives by applying targeted activation steering to distinct layers our approach achieves a better balance between the two competing dimensions effectively overcoming the limitations of current alignment techniques current tooluse large language models llms are trained on static datasets enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multistep toolintegrated reasoning which produces toolcall trajectories however these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic toolcall routine thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited performance in an evolved dynamic toolcall environment in this work we propose portool a reinforcement learning rl method that encourages a tooluse llm to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer specifically this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given query and some of them share the first few toolcall steps thereby forming a treelike structure next we assign rewards to each step based on its ability to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls a shared step across different trajectories receives the same reward while different steps under the same fork receive different rewards finally these stepwise rewards are used to calculate forkrelative advantages blended with trajectoryrelative advantages to train the llm for tool use the experiments utilize tools to address user queries covering both timesensitive and timeinvariant topics we conduct ablation studies to systematically justify the necessity and the design robustness of stepwise rewards furthermore we compare the proposed portool with other training approaches and demonstrate significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of toolcall steps large language models llms often struggle with problems that require multistep reasoning for smallscale opensource models reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards rlvr fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts while supervised finetuning sft tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid tokenbytoken imitation to address this gap we propose supervised reinforcement learning srl a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical actions srl trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action it provides smoother rewards based on the ilarity between the models actions and expert actions extracted from the sft dataset in a stepwise manner this supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations as a result srl enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by sft or rlvr moreover initializing training with srl before refining with rlvr yields the strongest overall performance beyond reasoning benchmarks srl generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoningoriented llms large language models llms are widely used in generative applications such as chatting code generation and reasoning however many realworld workloads such as classification question answering recommendation and text embedding rely solely on the prefill stage of inference where the model encodes input sequences without performing autoregressive decoding in these prefill only scenarios the selfattention computation becomes the primary performance bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length in this paper we observe that semantically different sentences often produce ilar attention maps across layers and heads building on this insight we propose attncache a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of llm inference by retrieving and reusing ilar attention maps based on an attention map memorization database attncache employs efficient caching and ilarity search techniques to identify and reuse precached attention maps during inference thereby reducing the computational overhead of selfattention experimental results show that attncache achieves an average of endtoend and attention speedup on cpu and endtoend and attention speedup on gpu with negligible accuracy degradation ai accelerators customized to ai workloads provide costeffective and highperformance solutions for training and inference trainium an ai accelerator recently developed by amazon web services aws provides an attractive option for llm training and inference through its heterogeneous architecture however leveraging trainium architecture for high performance can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special requirement on data layout in this paper we design highperformance matrix multiplication matmul a critical compute kernel for llm inference on trainium we introduce a series of techniques customized to trainium based on kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the softwaremanaged memory hierarchy maximize sram bandwidth and avoid expensive matrix transpose evaluating with nine datasets and four recent llms we show that our system largely outperforms the stateoftheart matmul implemented by aws on trainium at the level of matmul kernel it achieves an average speedup up to which translates to an average speedup up to for endtoend llm inference large language models llms often struggle with complex mathematical reasoning where prosebased generation leads to unverified and arithmetically unsound solutions current prompting strategies like chain of thought still operate within this unreliable medium lacking a mechanism for deterministic verification to address these limitations we introduce symcode a neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problemsolving as a task of verifiable code generation using the sympy library we evaluate symcode on challenging benchmarks including math and olympiadbench demonstrating significant accuracy improvements of up to percentage points over baselines our analysis shows that symcode is not only more tokenefficient but also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards transparent programmatic errors by grounding llm reasoning in a deterministic symbolic engine symcode represents a key step towards more accurate and trustworthy ai in formal domains machine translation mt is widely employed to address resource scarcity in lowresource languages by generating synthetic data from highresource counterparts while sentiment preservation in translation has long been studied a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment between source and target languages in this paper we hypothesize that semantic labels are drifted or altered during mt due to cultural divergence through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains we establish three key findings mt systems including modern large language models llms induce label drift during translation particularly in culturally sensitive domains unlike earlier statistical mt tools llms encode cultural knowledge and leveraging this knowledge can amplify label drift and cultural ilarity or dissimilarity between source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation our findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in mt not only undermines label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in downstream applications the impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large language models llms has been a topic of ongoing debate often raising concerns about potential tradeoffs between language coverage and model performance ie the curse of multilinguality in this work we investigate these assumptions by training and parameter llms on diverse multilingual corpora varying the number of languages from to our study challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training first we find that combining english and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the inlanguage performance of either group provided that languages have a sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus second we observe that using english as a pivot language ie a highresource language that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization yields benefits across language families and contrary to expectations selecting a pivot language from within a specific family does not consistently improve performance for languages within that family lastly we do not observe a significant curse of multilinguality as the number of training languages increases in models at this scale our findings suggest that multilingual data when balanced appropriately can enhance language model capabilities without compromising performance even in lowresource settings if we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model llm how can we ever know what it has seen we believe the most compelling evidence arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content as such we propose recap an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized training data from llm outputs at the heart of recap is a feedbackdriven loop where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language model which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies discrepancies these are then translated into minimal correction hints which are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations in addition to address alignmentinduced refusals recap includes a jailbreaking module that detects and overcomes such barriers we evaluate recap on echotrace a new benchmark spanning over full books and the results show that recap leads to substantial gains over singleiteration approaches for instance with gpt the average rougel score for the copyrighted text extraction improved from to a nearly increase the use of llmbased applications as a means to accelerate andor substitute human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality nonetheless despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of annotated datasets especially under a perspectivized approach to nlp is still missing this paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an extensive evaluation of the semiautomatization of framenetlike semantic annotation by the use of an llmbased semantic role labeler the methodology employed compares annotation time coverage and diversity in three experimental settings manual automatic and semiautomatic annotation results show that the hybrid semiautomatic annotation setting leads to increased frame diversity and ilar annotation coverage when compared to the humanonly setting while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all metrics except for annotation time posttraining of large language models llms is crucial for unlocking their task generalization potential and domainspecific capabilities however the current llm posttraining paradigm faces significant data challenges including the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data scales therefore achieving dataefficient posttraining has become a key research question in this paper we present the first systematic survey of dataefficient llm posttraining from a datacentric perspective we propose a taxonomy of dataefficient llm posttraining methods covering data selection data quality enhancement synthetic data generation data distillation and compression and selfevolving data ecosystems we summarize representative approaches in each category and outline future research directions by examining the challenges in dataefficient llm posttraining we highlight open problems and propose potential research avenues we hope our work inspires further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in largescale model training paper list electronic health records ehr store clinical documentation as base encoded attachments in fhir documentreference resources which makes semantic question answering difficult traditional vector database methods often miss nuanced clinical relationships the clinical entity augmented retrieval clear method introduced by lopez et al uses entity aware retrieval and achieved improved performance with an score of versus for embedding based retrieval while using over percent fewer tokens we developed a clinical notes qa evaluation platform to validate clear against zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval augmented generation the platform was tested on clinical notes ranging from to tokens representing realistic ehr content clear achieved a percent win rate an average semantic ilarity of and used percent fewer tokens than wide context processing the largest performance gains occurred on long notes with a percent win rate for documents exceeding tokens these findings confirm that entity aware retrieval improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing the evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and computational efficiency are critical there are two prevalent ways to constructing scenes procedural generation and lifting among them panoramabased lifting has emerged as a promising technique leveraging powerful generative priors to produce immersive realistic and diverse environments in this work we advance this technique to generate graphicsready scenes suitable for physically based rendering pbr relighting and ulation our key insight is to repurpose generative models for panoramic perception of geometry textures and pbr materials unlike existing lifting approaches that asize appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties we present omnix a versatile and unified framework based on a lightweight and efficient crossmodal adapter structure omnix reuses generative priors for a broad range of panoramic vision tasks including panoramic perception generation and completion furthermore we construct a largescale synthetic panorama dataset containing highquality multimodal panoramas from diverse indoor and outdoor scenes extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphicsready scene generation opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic virtual world generation we learn visual features by captioning images with an imageconditioned masked diffusion language model a formulation we call masked diffusion captioning mdc during training text tokens in each imagecaption pair are masked at a randomly chosen ratio and a decoder conditioned on visual features is trained to reconstruct the original text after training the learned visual features can be applied to downstream vision tasks unlike autoregressive captioning the strength of the visual learning signal in mdc does not depend on each tokens position in the sequence reducing the need for auxiliary objectives linear probing experiments across a variety of academicscale models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal content from casual videos without costly supervision existing videotod methods typically rely on manually annotated camera poses which are laborintensive and brittle for inthewild footage recent warptheninpaint approaches mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions thereby depicting the scene from diverse viewpoints however this trajectorytotrajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference we introduce seed a posefree trajectorytocamera framework that replaces explicit trajectory prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras thereby separating camera control from scene modeling a viewconditional video inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing regions across virtual viewpoints eliminating the need for explicit annotations building on this inpainting core we design a spatiotemporal autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtualcamera splines and extends videos with overlapping windows enabling coherent generation at bounded perstep complexity we validate seed on crossview video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks across quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments our method achieves superior generalization and improved performance relative to pose or trajectoryconditioned baselines advancing practical world modeling from casual videos determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale remains an unsolved challenge standard image retrieval techniques are inefficient due to the sheer volume of images and fail when coverage is insufficient scalable solutions however involve a tradeoff global classification typically yields coarse results kilometers while crossview retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions this paper introduces a hybrid approach that achieves finegrained geolocalization across a large geographic expanse the size of a continent we leverage a proxy classification task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly encode precise location information we combine these learned prototypes with embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of groundlevel data this enables direct finegrained retrieval over areas spanning multiple countries our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach can localize within more than of queries of a dataset covering a large part of europe the code is publicly available at despite recent advances in human motion generation mogen on standard benchmarks existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their generalization capability in contrast adjacent generative fields most notably video generation vigen have demonstrated remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors highlighting transferable insights that mogen can leverage motivated by this observation we present a comprehensive framework that systematically transfers knowledge from vigen to mogen across three key pillars data modeling and evaluation first we introduce vimogenk a largescale dataset comprising highquality motion samples that integrates highfidelity optical mocap data with semantically annotated motions from web videos and synthesized samples generated by stateoftheart vigen models the dataset includes both textmotion pairs and textvideomotion triplets substantially expanding semantic diversity second we propose vimogen a flowmatchingbased diffusion transformer that unifies priors from mocap data and vigen models through gated multimodal conditioning to enhance efficiency we further develop vimogenlight a distilled variant that eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong generalization finally we present mbench a hierarchical benchmark designed for finegrained evaluation across motion quality prompt fidelity and generalization ability extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations the code data and benchmark will be made publicly available hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields including computer vision graphics and robotics where complex dynamics typically arise from coordinated interactions among pler motion components existing methods to model such dynamics typically rely on manuallydefined or heuristic hierarchies with fixed motion primitives limiting their generalizability across different tasks in this work we propose a general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured interpretable motion relationships directly from data our method represents observed motions using graphbased hierarchies explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into parentinherited patterns and local motion residuals we formulate hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem where vertices represent elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parentchild dependencies through graph neural networks we evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction approach on three examples translational motion rotational motion and dynamic scene deformation via gaussian splatting experimental results show that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in and cases and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the baseline on dynamic gaussian splatting scenes by providing an adaptable datadriven hierarchical modeling paradigm our method offers a formulation applicable to a broad range of motioncentric tasks project page charts play an important role in visualization reasoning data analysis and the exchange of ideas among humans however existing visionlanguage models vlms still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract finegrained structures from charts such limitations in chart grounding also hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them in this paper we introduce a novel chartalign benchmark chartab to provide a comprehensive evaluation of vlms in chart grounding tasks ie extracting tabular data localizing visualization elements and recognizing various attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities we design a json template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically tailored for each grounding task by incorporating a novel twostage inference workflow the benchmark can further evaluate vlms capability to align and compare elementsattributes across two charts our analysis of evaluations on several recent vlms reveals new insights into their perception biases weaknesses robustness and hallucinations in chart understanding these findings highlight the finegrained discrepancies among vlms in chart understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened in current models agerelated macular degeneration amd is one of the leading causes of irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of this research focuses on semantic segmentation for amd lesion detection in rgb fundus images a noninvasive and costeffective imaging technique the results of the adam challenge the most comprehensive amd detection from rgb fundus images research competition and open dataset to date serve as a benchmark for our evaluation taking the unet connectivity as a base of our framework we evaluate and compare several approaches to

mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels the main outcome of this research is the final configuration of the amd detection framework which outperforms all the prior adam challenge submissions on the multiclass segmentation of different amd lesion types in noninvasive rgb fundus images the source code used to conduct the experiments presented in this paper is made freely available this work introduces steervlm a lightweight steering module designed to guide visionlanguage models vlms towards outputs that better adhere to desired instructions our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust activations connecting the language modality with image context this allows for finegrained inferencetime control over complex output semantics without modifying model weights while preserving performance on offtarget tasks our steering module requires learning parameters equal to of the original vlms size our steering module gains model control through dimensionwise activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring preextracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points furthermore we introduce vnia visual narrative intent alignment a multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and evaluation of vlm steering techniques our method outperforms existing intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for vlms and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through activation engineering since its introduction gaussian splatting dgs has rapidly transformed the landscape of scene representations inspiring an extensive body of associated research followup work includes analyses and contributions that enhance the efficiency scalability and realworld applicability of dgs in this summary we present an overview of several key directions that have emerged in the wake of dgs we highlight advances enabling resourceefficient training and rendering the evolution toward dynamic or fourdimensional dgs representations and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process furthermore we examine efforts to bring dgs to mobile and virtual reality platforms its extension to massivescale environments and recent progress toward nearinstant radiance field reconstruction via feedforward or distributed computation collectively these developments illustrate how dgs has evolved from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for vision and graphics we present a longterm deployment study of a machine visionbased anomaly detection system for failure prediction in a steel rolling mill the system integrates industrial cameras to monitor equipment operation alignment and hot bar motion in real time along the process line live video streams are processed on a centralized video server using deep learning models enabling early prediction of equipment failures and process interruptions thereby reducing unplanned breakdown costs serverbased inference minimizes the computational load on industrial process control systems plcs supporting scalable deployment across production lines with minimal additional resources by jointly analyzing sensor data from data acquisition systems and visual inputs the system identifies the location and probable root causes of failures providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance this integrated approach enhances operational reliability productivity and profitability in industrial manufacturing environments the presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to typicallypowerful object recognition algorithms additional sources of information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision in this work we attempt to add robustness into existing region proposal networkdeep convolutional neural network rpndcnn object detection networks through two distinct scenebased information fusion techniques we present one algorithm under each methodology the first operates prior to prediction selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background scene and the second operates after detection fusing scene knowledge into initial object scores output by the rpn we demonstrate our algorithms on challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions which show overall improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods in addition our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion handling finding that training on a combination of both occluded and unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others our method is interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets offering many future directions for research and practical applications accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for arctic navigation climate research and operational forecasting while optical flow a computer vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images has advanced rapidly in computer vision its applicability to geophysical problems and to satellite sar imagery remains underexplored classical optical flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios recent deep learning based approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in computer vision motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation we present the first large scale benchmark of deep learning optical flow models on radarsat scansar sea ice imagery evaluated with endpoint error epe and fl all metrics against gnss tracked buoys several models achieve sub kilometer accuracy epe to pixels to a small error relative to the spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the arctic our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical flow methods which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy compared to classical methods can be effectively transferred to polar remote sensing optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields providing motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling autonomous vehicles avs are transforming the future of transportation through advances in intelligent perception decisionmaking and control systems however their success is tied to one core capability reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments while recent breakthroughs in computer vision cv and artificial intelligence ai have driven remarkable progress the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception contextual reasoning and cooperative intelligence this survey bridges that gap by delivering a forwardlooking analysis of object detection in avs asizing emerging paradigms such as visionlanguage models vlms large language models llms and generative ai rather than reexamining outdated techniques we begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of av sensors camera ultrasonic lidar and radar and their fusion strategies highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic

object detection such as complex backgrounds severe occlusion dense small objects and varying lighting conditionsthis paper proposes ptdetr based on rtdetr a novel detection algorithm specifically designed for small objects in uav imagery in the backbone network we introduce the partiallyaware detail focus padf module to enhance feature extraction for small objects additionallywe design the medianfrequency feature fusion mfff modulewhich effectively improves the models ability to capture smallobject details and contextual information furthermorewe incorporate focalersiou to strengthen the models bounding box matching capability and increase its sensitivity to smallobject features thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness compared with rtdetr our ptdetr achieves map improvements of and on the visdrone dataset with lower computational complexity and fewer parameters demonstrating its robustness and feasibility for smallobject detection tasks we propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer spiking patches specifically designed for event cameras given a stream of asynchronous and spatially sparse events our goal is to discover an event representation that preserves these properties prior works have represented events as frames or as voxels however while these representations yield high accuracy both frames and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity spiking patches gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy we evaluate our tokenizer using a gnn pcn and a transformer on gesture recognition and object detection tokens from spiking patches yield inference times that are up to faster than voxelbased tokens and up to faster than frames we achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases with absolute improvements up to for gesture recognition and up to for object detection thus tokenization constitutes a novel direction in eventbased vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the properties of event cameras accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security and modern agricultural management traditional methods often lack the scalability and granularity required for precision farming this paper introduces cypress crop yield

specialized agricultural applications by providing a continuous highresolution output cypress offers a more actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or countylevel aggregation methods this work validates a novel approach that bridges the gap between largescale earth observation and onfarm decisionmaking offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural monitoring computational superresolution csr in fluorescence microscopy has despite being an illposed problem a long history at its very core csr is about finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph that have never been imaged by the imagegenerating microscope it stands to reason that with the advent of better datadriven machine learning techniques stronger prior can be learned and hence csr can lead to better results here we present resmatching a novel csr method that uses guided conditional flow matching to learn such improved datapriors we evaluate resmatching on diverse biological structures from the biosr dataset and compare its results against baselines resmatching consistently achieves competitive results demonstrating in all cases the best tradeoff between data fidelity and perceptual realism we observe that csr using resmatching is particularly effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn eg when the given lowresolution images contain a lot of noise additionally we show that resmatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested usecases enabling our method to deliver a pixelwise datauncertainty term that can guide future users to reject uncertain predictions we introduce emu a largescale multimodal world model that natively predicts the next state across vision and language emu is pretrained endtoend with a unified nexttoken prediction objective on a corpus of visionlanguage interleaved data containing over trillion tokens primarily derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos the model naturally accepts interleaved visionlanguage inputs and generates interleaved visionlanguage outputs emu is further posttrained with largescale reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation to improve inference efficiency we propose discrete diffusion adaptation dida which converts tokenbytoken decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction accelerating perimage inference by about without sacrificing performance emu exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities including longhorizon visionlanguage generation anytoimage xi generation and complex textrich image generation it also exhibits generalizable worldmodeling abilities enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and openworld embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks for comparison emu achieves performance comparable to gemini flash image nano banana on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks we opensource emu at to support community research recent advances in visual question answering vqa have demonstrated impressive performance in natural image domains with models like llava leveraging large language models llms for openended reasoning however their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to outofdomain scenarios such as remote sensing medical imaging or math diagrams due to large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation mechanisms existing approaches typically rely on perdomain finetuning or bespoke pipelines which are costly inflexible and not scalable across diverse tasks in this paper we propose catch a plugandplay framework for crossdomain adaptation that improves the generalization of vqa models while requiring minimal changes to their core architecture our key idea is to decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight modules a domain classifier to identify the input image type and a dual adapter mechanism comprising a prompt adapter for language modulation and a visual adapter for vision feature adjustment both modules are dynamically injected via a unified hook interface requiring no retraining of the backbone model experimental results across four domainspecific vqa benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without retraining the backbone model including bleu on mathvqa vqa on medvqarad and rouge on chartqa these results highlight that catch provides a scalable and extensible approach to multidomain vqa enabling practical deployment across diverse application domains in realworld environments ai systems often face unfamiliar scenarios without labeled data creating a major challenge for conventional scene understanding models the inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits the deployment of visionbased applications in dynamic unstructured settings this work introduces a dynamic contextaware scene reasoning framework that leverages visionlanguage alignment to address zeroshot realworld scenarios the goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new environments without prior taskspecific training the proposed approach integrates pretrained vision transformers and large language models to align visual semantics with natural language descriptions enhancing contextual comprehension a dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining global scene cues and objectlevel interactions guided by linguistic priors extensive experiments on zeroshot benchmarks such as coco visual genome and open images demonstrate up to improvement in scene understanding accuracy over baseline models in complex and unseen environments results also show robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic fusion of vision and language this framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach for contextaware reasoning advancing zeroshot generalization in dynamic realworld settings advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement ad at varying durations for a single campaign the traditional approach involves manually selecting and reediting shots from longer video ads to create shorter versions which is laborintensive and timeconsuming in this paper we introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization techniques we are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection problem tailored specifically for advertising unlike existing general video summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content our approach asizes the critical role of audio in advertising to achieve this we develop a twostream audiovisual fusion model that predicts the importance of video frames where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being selected in the firmproduced short ad to address the lack of adspecific datasets we present adsum a novel dataset comprising pairs of second and second ads from real advertising campaigns extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms stateoftheart methods across various metrics including average precision area under curve spearman and kendall spine segmentation based on ultrasound volume projection imaging vpi plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical applications however this task faces several significant challenges firstly the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be welllearned if we neglect the high spatial correlation of different bone features secondly the spine bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process to address these challenges we propose a novel scaleadaptive structureaware network sanet for effective spine segmentation first we propose a scaleadaptive complementary strategy to learn the crossdimensional longdistance correlation features for spinal images second motivated by the consistency between multihead selfattention in transformers and semantic level affinity we propose structureaffinity transformation to transform semantic features with classspecific affinity and combine it with a transformer decoder for structureaware reasoning in addition we adopt a feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training this method improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process the experimental results demonstrate that our sanet achieves superior segmentation performance compared to other stateoftheart methods moreover the adaptability of sanet to various backbones enhances its potential as a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal image analysis the code and experimental demo are available at the edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract relevant information from an image one recurring problem in this task is the weaknesses found in some detectors such as the difficulty in detecting loose edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific problems to address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties of an image an adaptable detector described by twodimensional cellular automaton and optimized by metaheuristic combined with transfer learning techniques was developed this study aims to analyze the impact of expanding the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set the results obtained prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not effective for the chosen image set the study also analyzed the adaptability of the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found that regardless of the validation the model was able to adapt to the input and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant improvements selfimprovement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of large visionlanguage models lvlms where models explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively however we identify a critical issue during this process the model excels at generating highquality trajectories for ple queries ie head data but struggles with more complex ones ie tail data this leads to an imbalanced optimization that drives the model to prioritize ple reasoning skills while hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks over iterations this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounceda dynamic we term the matthew effectwhich ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to performance bottlenecks to counteract this challenge we introduce four efficient strategies from two perspectives distributionreshaping and trajectoryresampling to achieve headtail rebalancing during the explorationandlearning selfimprovement process extensive experiments on qwenvlbinstruct and internvlb models across visual reasoning tasks demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning capabilities outperforming vanilla selfimprovement by points on average objectcontext shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in visionlanguage models undermining zeroshot reliability when testtime scenes differ from familiar training cooccurrences we recast this issue as a causal inference problem and ask would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a different environment to answer this at inference time we estimate object and background expectations within clips representation space and synthesize counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse alternative contexts sampled from external datasets batch neighbors or textderived descriptions by estimating the total direct effect and ulating intervention we further subtract backgroundonly activation preserving beneficial objectcontext interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores without retraining or prompt design our method substantially improves both worstgroup and average accuracy on contextsensitive benchmarks establishing a new zeroshot state of the art beyond performance our framework provides a lightweight representationlevel counterfactual approach offering a practical causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning fewshot anomaly detection fsad methods identify anomalous regions with few known normal samples most existing methods rely on the generalization ability of pretrained visionlanguage models vlms to recognize potentially anomalous regions through feature ilarity between text descriptions and images however due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions these methods can only predefine imagelevel descriptions to match each visual patch token to identify potential anomalous regions which leads to the semantic misalignment between image descriptions and patchlevel visual anomalies achieving suboptimal localization performance to address the above issues we propose the multilevel finegrained semantic caption mfsc to provide multilevel and finegrained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with automatic construction pipeline based on the mfsc we propose a novel framework named finegrainedad to improve anomaly localization performance which consists of two components multilevel learnable prompt mllp and multilevel semantic alignment mlsa mllp introduces finegrained semantics into multilevel learnable prompts through automatic replacement and concatenation mechanism while mlsa designs region aggregation strategy and multilevel alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align with corresponding visual regions experiments demonstrate that the proposed finegrainedad achieves superior overall performance in fewshot settings on mvtecad and visa datasets recent advances in foundational reconstruction models such as dustr and mastr have shown great potential in and correspondence in static scenes in this paper we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking through grounded correspondence we first demonstrate that these models are competitive point trackers when focusing on static points present in current point tracking benchmarks on egopoints vs cotracker we propose to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence along with a visibility head and finetuning mastr for point tracking using a relatively small amount of synthetic data importantly we only train and evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point effectively removing any temporal context using a mix of dynamic and static point correspondences we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on four datasets eg competitive on tapviddavis deltaavg occlusion acc for pointstr compared to for cotracker and significantly outperform cotracker on egopoints vs and rgbs vs we also present results on point tracking along with several ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences testtime prompt tuning tpt has emerged as a promising technique for adapting large visionlanguage models vlms to unseen tasks without relying on labeled data however the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt calibration performance which raises concerns about vlms reliability trustworthiness and safety current tpt approaches primarily focus on improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular separation however these methods may not always have optimal angular separation between classwise textual features which implies overlooking the critical role of angular diversity to address this we propose atpt a novel tpt framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable prompts this uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance between features on the unit hypersphere we show that our approach consistently surpasses stateoftheart tpt methods in reducing the aggregate average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets notably our approach exhibits superior zeroshot calibration performance on natural distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets we provide extensive analyses including theoretical aspects to establish the grounding of atpt these results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to achieve welldispersed textual features significantly improving vlm calibration during testtime adaptation our code will be made publicly available recently texttovideo generation has made impressive progress in producing short highquality clips but evaluating longform outputs remains a major challenge especially when processing complex prompts existing benchmarks mostly rely on plified prompts and focus on lowlevel metrics overlooking finegrained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative coherence and thematic expression to address these gaps we propose locotvbench a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation lvg under complex input conditions based on various realworld videos locotvbench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating elements like scene transitions and event dynamics moreover it constructs a multidimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics such as eventlevel alignment finegrained temporal consistency content clarity and the human expectation realization degree herd that focuses on more abstract attributes like narrative flow emotional response and character development using this framework we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine representative lvg models finding that while current methods perform well on basic visual and temporal aspects they struggle with interevent consistency finegrained alignment and highlevel thematic adherence etc overall locotvbench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for evaluating longform complex texttovideo generation and highlights critical directions for future method improvement existing eegdriven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial attention mechanisms limiting fidelity and semantic coherence to address this we propose a dualconditioning framework that combines eeg embeddings with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation our approach leverages the adaptive thinking mapper atm for eeg feature extraction and finetunes stable diffusion via lowrank adaptation lora to align neural signals with visual semantics while a controlnet branch conditions generation on saliency maps for spatial control evaluated on thingseeg our method achieves a significant improvement in the quality of low and highlevel image features over existing approaches ultaneously strongly aligning with human visual attention the results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve eeg ambiguities enabling highfidelity reconstructions with applications in medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces advancing neural decoding through efficient adaptation of pretrained diffusion models image superresolutionsr is fundamental to many vision systemfrom surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analyticsbecause recovering highfrequency details especially scenetext enables reliable downstream perception scenetext ie text embedded in natural images such as signs product labels and storefronts often carries the most actionable information when characters are blurred or hallucinated optical

lipis maniqa clipiqa musiq that are largely insensitive to characterlevel errors furthermore studies that do address text sr often focus on plified benchmarks with isolated characters overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes as a result scenetext is effectively treated as generic texture for sr to be effective in practical deployments it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for both text legibility and perceptual quality we present glyphsr a visionlanguageguided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives jointly glyphsr utilizes a textsr fusion controlnettscontrolnet guided by ocr data and a pingpong scheduler that alternates between text and scenecentric guidance to enable targeted text restoration we train these components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main sr branch frozen across svt scutctw and cute at and glyphsr improves ocr by up to percentage points over diffusiongan baseline svt openocr while maintaining competitive maniqa clipiqa and musiq glyphsr is designed to satisfy both objectives ultaneouslyhigh readability and high visual realismdelivering sr that looks right and reds right diabetic retinopathy dr is a leading cause of vision loss among middleaged and elderly people which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental health to improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early detection of dr a variety of automated dr diagnosis systems have been recently established based on convolutional neural network cnn or vision transformer vit however due to the own shortages of cnn vit the performance of existing methods using singletype backbone has reached a bottleneck one potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of backbones which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them ie the local feature extraction capability of cnn and the global feature capturing ability of vit to this end we propose a novel paradigm to effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the theory of evidence specifically the proposed evidential fusion paradigm transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via a set of deep evidential networks with the supporting evidences the aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed which can be used to adaptively tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the performance of our hybrid model we evaluated our method on two publicly available dr grading datasets the experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of dr grading compared to the stateoftheart frameworks but also provides the excellent interpretability for feature fusion and decisionmaking the subject of this work is to check how different types of music affect human emotions while listening to music a subjective survey and brain activity measurements were carried out using an eeg helmet the aim is to demonstrate the impact of different music genres on emotions the research involved a diverse group of participants of different gender and musical preferences this had the effect of capturing a wide range of emotional responses to music after the experiment a relationship analysis of the respondents questionnaires with eeg signals was performed the analysis revealed connections between emotions and observed brain activity agile earth observation satellites aeoss constellations offer unprecedented flexibility for monitoring the earths surface but their scheduling remains challenging under largescale scenarios dynamic environments and stringent constraints existing methods often plify these complexities limiting their realworld performance we address this gap with a unified framework integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model our benchmark suite aeosbench contains finely tuned satellite assets and scenarios each scenario features to satellites and to imaging tasks these scenarios are generated via a highfidelity ulation platform ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital dynamics and resource constraints ground truth scheduling annotations are provided for each scenario to our knowledge aeosbench is the first largescale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling building upon this benchmark we introduce aeosformer a transformerbased scheduling model that incorporates a constraintaware attention mechanism a dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and operational limits of each satellite through ulationbased iterative learning aeosformer adapts to diverse scenarios offering a robust solution for aeos constellation scheduling experimental results demonstrate that aeosformer outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy efficiency with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each component code and data are provided in we focus on ocular biometrics specifically the periocular region the area around the eye which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition constraints we evaluate three convolutional neural network architectures of varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular recognition the networks are trained on ocular crops extracted from the largescale vggface database this significantly contrasts with existing works which typically rely on smallscale periocular datasets for training having only a few thousand images experiments are conducted with ocular images from vggfacepose a subset of vggface containing inthewild face images and the ufprperiocular database which consists of selfies captured via mobile devices with user guidance on the screen due to the uncontrolled conditions of vggface the equal error rates eers obtained with ocular crops range from noticeably higher than the eers achieved using fullface images in contrast ufprperiocular yields significantly better performance eers of thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition protocols to the best of our knowledge these are the lowest reported eers on the ufpr dataset to date planning is a critical component of endtoend autonomous driving however prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse failing to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses meanwhile existing generative approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs to address these limitations we propose catg a novel planning framework that leverages constrained flow matching concretely catg explicitly models the flow matching process which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit constraints directly within the flow matching process ensuring that the generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules secondly catg parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style notably on the navsim challenge catg achieved nd place with an epdms score of and was honored with the innovation award we study the complementarity of different cnns for periocular verification at different distances on the ubipr database we train three architectures of increasing complexity squeezenet mobilenetv and resnet on a large set of eye crops from vggface we analyse performance with cosine and chi metrics compare different network initialisations and apply scorelevel fusion via logistic regression in addition we use lime heatmaps and jensenshannon divergence to compare attention patterns of the cnns while resnet consistently performs best individually the fusion provides substantial gains especially when combining all three networks heatmaps show that networks usually focus on distinct regions of a given image which explains their complementarity our method significantly outperforms previous works on ubipr achieving a new stateoftheart existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of balancing modal information generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images by learning from data distributions but their generative capabilities remain limited moreover the lack of interpretability in modal information selection further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex scenarios this manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and visible image fusion method termed hclfuse first hclfuse investigates the quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks which leads to the design of a multiscale maskregulated variational bottleneck encoder this encoder applies posterior probability modeling and information decomposition to extract accurate and concise lowlevel modal information thereby supporting the generation of highfidelity structural details furthermore the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion model is integrated with physical laws forming a timevarying physical guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at different stages thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality experimental results show that the proposed method achieves stateoftheart fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics this fully demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method drawing inspiration from human cognition in enhancing structural consistency and detail quality modern visionlanguage models vlms excel at many multimodal tasks yet their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and crucially underevaluated we probe this gap with a deceptively ple but revealing challenge judging the arrow of time aotwhether a short clip is played forward or backward we introduce aotpsyphybench a psychophysically validated benchmark that tests whether vlms can infer temporal direction in natural videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans our comprehensive evaluation of openweight and proprietary reasoning and nonreasoning vlms reveals that most models perform near chance and even the best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes eg free fall diffusionexplosion and causal manual actions divisionaddition that humans recognize almost instantly these results highlight a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems while they capture rich visualsemantic correlations they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity and causal understanding we release the code and data for aotpsyphybench to encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities of vlms document ai has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention yet while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis dla its generative counterpart document layout generation remains underexplored a major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts academic papers with manhattanstyle structures dominate existing studies while openworld genres such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented to address this gap we curate omnilayoutm the first millionscale dataset of diverse document layouts covering six common document types and comprising contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources moreover since existing methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences coherently we introduce omnilayoutllm a model with designed twostage coarsetofine learning paradigm learning universal layout principles from omnilayoutm with coarse category definitions and transferring the knowledge to a specific domain with finegrained annotations extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on multiple domains in mdoc dataset substantially surpassing both existing layout generation experts and several latest generalpurpose llms our code models and dataset will be publicly released the sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal performance in controlling the supply chain the management of risks that occur in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the supply chain the correct classification of products is another essential element in a sustainable supply chain acknowledging recent breakthroughs in the context of deep networks several architectural options have been deployed to analyze supply chain datasets a novel geometric deep network is used to propose an ensemble deep network the proposed chebyshev ensemble geometric network chegn is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning this network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to derive invisible states of samples in the database the functionality of the proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases the supplygraph dataset and dataco are considered in this research the prediction of delivery status of dataco supply chain is done for risk administration the product classification and edge classification are performed using the supplygraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network an average accuracy of is obtained for the ensemble network for risk management the average accuracy of and are obtained for sustainable supply chain in terms of product group classification and product relation classification respectively the average accuracy of is attained for company relation classification the results confirm an average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the stateoftheart approaches human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer animation and film production unlike traditional human pose estimation this task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature of sketches previous sketchtopose methods constrained by the lack of largescale sketchd pose annotations primarily relied on optimization with heuristic rulesan approach that is both timeconsuming and limited in generalizability to address these challenges we propose a novel approach leveraging a learn from synthesis strategy first a diffusion model is trained to synthesize sketch images from poses projected from human poses mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches this process enables the creation of a synthetic dataset skepk consisting of accurate sketchd pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles building on this synthetic dataset we introduce an endtoend datadriven framework for estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles our framework combines existing pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch feature extraction with a feedforward neural network for efficient pose estimation multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee geometric coherence between the derived poses and the detected poses while preserving accurate selfcontacts qualitative quantitative and subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketchtopose tasks dataset bias where data points are skewed to certain concepts is ubiquitous in machine learning datasets yet systematically identifying these biases is challenging without costly finegrained attribute annotations we present conceptscope a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets by discovering and quantifying humaninterpretable concepts using sparse autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models conceptscope categorizes concepts into target context and bias types based on their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels enabling classlevel dataset characterization bias identification and robustness evaluation through conceptbased subgrouping we validate that conceptscope captures a wide range of visual concepts including objects textures backgrounds facial attributes emotions and actions through comparisons with annotated datasets furthermore we show that concept activations produce spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions conceptscope reliably detects known biases eg background bias in waterbirds and uncovers previously unannotated ones eg cooccurring objects in imagenet offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model diagnostics accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational imaging and computer vision applications researchers have investigated various methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image including blur kernels and optical flow however existing motion representations are often of low quality ie coarsegrained and inaccurate in this paper we propose the first highresolution hr motion trajectory estimation framework using diffusion models motdiff different from existing motion representations we aim to estimate an hr motion trajectory with highquality from a single motionblurred image the proposed motdiff consists of two key components a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multiscale feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition and a new training method that can promote precise identification of a finegrained motion trajectory consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a motion path and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory our experiments demonstrate that the proposed motdiff can outperform stateoftheart methods in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people interact with their surroundings enabling users to seek information regarding entities in their view multimodal retrievalaugmented generation mmrag plays a key role in supporting such questions yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark for this task especially regarding wearables scenarios to fill this gap we present cragmm a comprehensive rag benchmark for multimodal multiturn conversations cragmm contains a diverse set of image question answer triplets and visualbased multiturn conversations across domains including egocentric images designed to mimic captures from wearable devices we carefully constructed the questions to reflect realworld scenarios and challenges including five types of imagequality issues six question types varying entity popularity differing information dynamism and different conversation turns we design three tasks singlesource augmentation multisource augmentation and multiturn conversations each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and apis for both imagekg retrieval and webpage retrieval our evaluation shows that straightforward rag approaches achieve only and truthfulness on cragmm single and multiturn qa respectively whereas stateoftheart industry solutions have ilar quality underscoring ample room for improvement the benchmark has hosted kdd cup attracting about participants and submissions with winning solutions improving baseline performance by highlighting its early impact on advancing the field modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical location and cultural context in south asian countries rickshaws are among the most common means of local transport based on their mode of operation rickshaws in cities across bangladesh can be broadly classified into nonauto pedalpowered and autorickshaws motorized monitoring the movement of autorickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict autorickshaws from accessing certain routes however existing surveillance systems make it quite difficult to monitor them due to their ilarity to other vehicles especially nonauto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too timeconsuming this paper presents a machine learningbased approach to automatically detect autorickshaws in traffic images in this system we used realtime object detection using the yolov model for training purposes we prepared a set of annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions the results show that our proposed model performs well in realtime autorickshaw detection and offers an map of and binary precision and recall values above demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse traffic scenarios the dataset has been publicly released for further research large annotated datasets are essential for training robust computeraided diagnosis cad models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction however acquiring such datasets with finedetailed annotation is both costly and timeconsuming visionlanguage models vlms such as clip which are pretrained on large imagetext pairs offer a promising solution by enhancing robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks this paper introduces a novel multiview mammography and language model for breast cancer classification and risk prediction trained on a dataset of paired mammogram images and synthetic radiology reports our mvmlm leverages multiview supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by employing crossmodal selfsupervision across imagetext pairs this includes multiple views and the corresponding pseudoradiology reports we propose a novel joint visualtextual learning strategy to enhance generalization and accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast tissues or cancer characteristicscalcification mass and utilize these patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk we evaluated our method on both private and publicly available datasets demonstrating that the proposed model achieves stateoftheart performance in three classification tasks malignancy classification subtype classification and imagebased cancer risk prediction furthermore the model exhibits strong data efficiency outperforming existing fully supervised or vlm baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need for actual radiology reports arbitraryscale video superresolution avsr aims to enhance the resolution of video frames potentially at various scaling factors which presents several challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction temporal consistency and computational complexity in this paper we propose a strong baseline basicavsr for avsr by integrating four key components adaptive multiscale frequency priors generated from image laplacian pyramids a flowguided propagation unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames a secondorder motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of adjacent frames and a hyperupsampling unit to generate scaleaware and contentindependent upsampling kernels to meet diverse application demands we instantiate three propagation variants i a unidirectional rnn unit for strictly online inference ii a unidirectional rnn unit empowered with a limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay and iii a bidirectional rnn unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources are less constrained experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our model across these different scenarios through extensive experiments we show that basicavsr significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of superresolution quality generalization ability and inference speed our work not only advances the stateoftheart in avsr but also extends its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios the code is available at large language models llms in psychological counseling have attracted increasing attention however existing approaches often lack emotional understanding adaptive strategies and the use of therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with longterm memory leaving them far from real clinical practice to address these critical gaps we introduce theramind a strategic and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling the cornerstone of theramind is a novel dualloop architecture that decouples the complex counseling process into an intrasession loop for tactical dialogue management and a crosssession loop for strategic therapeutic planning the intrasession loop perceives the patients emotional state to dynamically select response strategies while leveraging crosssession memory to ensure continuity crucially the crosssession loop empowers the agent with longterm adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions we validate our approach in a highfidelity ulation environment grounded in real clinical cases extensive evaluations show that theramind outperforms other methods especially on multisession metrics like coherence flexibility and therapeutic attunement validating the effectiveness of its dualloop design in emulating strategic adaptive and longitudinal therapeutic behavior the code is publicly available at retrievalaugmented generation allows llms to access external knowledge reducing hallucinations and ageingdata issues however it treats retrieved chunks independently and struggles with multihop or relational reasoning especially across documents knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the relationships between entities using triplets enabling structured multichunk reasoning however these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the triplet structure we introduce bambookg a knowledge graph with frequencybased weights on nontriplet edges which reflect link strength drawing on the hebbian principle of fire together wire together this decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single and multihop reasoning outperforming the existing solutions unmanned aerial vehicles uavs are increasingly populating urban areas for delivery and surveillance purposes in this work we develop an optimal navigation strategy based on deep reinforcement learning the environment is represented by a threedimensional highfidelity ulation of an urban flow characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones the algorithm presented here is a flowaware proximal policy optimization ppo combined with a gated transformer extra large gtrxl architecture giving the agent richer information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates the results are compared with a ppogtrxl without the secondary prediction tasks a ppo combined with long short term memory lstm cells and a traditional navigation algorithm the obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate sr and a lower crash rate cr compared to a ppolstm ppogtrxl and the classical zermelos navigation algorithm paving the way to a completely reimagined uav landscape in complex urban environments visionlanguage models vlms excel at interpreting textrich images but struggle with long visually complex documents that demand analysis and integration of information spread across multiple pages existing approaches typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines which force vlms into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization we present active longdocument navigation alden a multiturn reinforcement learning framework that finetunes vlms as interactive agents capable of actively navigating long visually rich documents alden introduces a novel fetch action that directly accesses the page by index complementing the classic search action and better exploiting document structure for dense process supervision and efficient training we propose a rulebased crosslevel reward that provides both turn and tokenlevel signals to address the empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from long documents we further propose a visualsemantic anchoring mechanism that applies a dualpath kldivergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual representations separately during training trained on a corpus constructed from three opensource datasets alden achieves stateoftheart performance on five longdocument benchmarks overall alden marks a step beyond passive document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across long visually rich documents offering a robust path to more accurate and efficient longdocument understanding an agentic ai workflow aaw also known as an llmbased multiagent system is an autonomous system that assembles several llmbased agents to work collaboratively towards a shared goal the high autonomy widespread adoption and growing interest in such aaws highlight the need for a deeper understanding of their operations from both quality and security aspects to this day there are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the aaws final output adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since existing methods perform only static structural analysis which is unsuitable for inference time execution we present counterfactualbased agent influence ranker cair the first method for assessing the influence level of each agent on the aaws output and determining which agents are the most influential by performing counterfactual analysis cair provides a taskagnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time we evaluate cair using an aaws dataset of our creation containing different use cases with different functionalities our evaluation showed that cair produces consistent rankings outperforms baseline methods and can easily enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks the diagnosis of most mental disorders including psychiatric evaluations primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients this subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and patients resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable outcomes to address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses we propose a finetuned large language model llm consortium and openaigptoss reasoning llmenabled decision support system for the clinical diagnosis of mental disorders our approach leverages finetuned llms trained on conversational datasets involving psychiatristpatient interactions focused on mental health conditions eg depression the diagnostic predictions from individual models are aggregated through a consensusbased decisionmaking process refined by the openaigptoss reasoning llm we propose a novel method for deploying llm agents that orchestrate communication between the llm consortium and the reasoning llm ensuring transparency reliability and responsible ai across the entire diagnostic workflow experimental results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining finetuned llms with a reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for mental health assessment a prototype of the proposed platform integrating three finetuned llms with the openaigptoss reasoning llm was developed in collaboration with the us army medical research team in norfolk virginia usa to the best of our knowledge this work represents the first application of a finetuned llm consortium integrated with a reasoning llm for clinical mental health diagnosis paving the way for nextgeneration aipowered ehealth systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning rl as it determines how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its environment to achieve optimal performance existing exploration methods generally fall into two categories active exploration and passive exploration the former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in highdimensional environments while the latter adaptively prioritizes transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration yet remains constrained by limited sample diversity to address the limitation in passive exploration we propose modelic generative exploration moge which augments exploration through the generation of underexplored critical states and synthesis of dynamicsconsistent experiences through transition models moge is composed of two components a diffusionbased generator that synthesizes critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each states potential influence on policy exploration and a onestep imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the critical states for agent learning our method adopts a modular formulation that aligns with the principles of offpolicy learning allowing seamless integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering their core structures empirical results on openai gym and deepmind control suite reveal that moge effectively bridges exploration and policy learning leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks zero reinforcement learning zerorl has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models llms by directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained models without the need for a supervised finetuning phase however current research on zerorl primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward signals such as mathematics programming and other reasoning tasks the challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios where verification is not straightforward remains underexplored to address this gap we propose a novel zerorl paradigm designed to improve a models reasoning ability across both verifiable and nonverifiable domains by combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model we conduct multitask zerorl training across both domains facilitating the transfer of reasoning capabilities between them furthermore to mitigate reward hacking in the generative reward model we design a smooth length penalty that encourages the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains experimental results on qwenbbase and qwenbbase demonstrate that our approach achieves superior reasoning performance not only on tasks requiring extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks retrievalaugmented

iterative subquery decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction contextual acronym resolution and crossencoderbased context reranking we evaluate our approach against a standard rag baseline using a curated dataset of questionanswerreference triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base experimental results demonstrate that the agentic rag system outperforms the baseline in retrieval precision and relevance albeit with increased latency these findings suggest that structured multiagent methodologies offer a promising direction for enhancing retrieval robustness in complex domainspecific settings in this paper we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic rules using large language models llms in the context of inductive logic programming various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed predicates with predicate invention being a key example this hinders the readability interpretability and reusability of the logic theory leveraging recent advancements in llms development we explore their ability to process natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for giving a name to unnamed predicates the evaluation of our approach on some handcrafted logic rules indicates that llms hold potential for this task as large language models llms are increasingly used in texttosql tasks reinforcement learning rl has become a common method for improving performance existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback which restricts realtime error correction however integrating multiturn tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve adaptability and robustness ultimately enhancing model performance to address these issues we propose mtirsql an innovative multiturn toolintegrated reasoning reinforcement learning framework for texttosql our approach introduces an executionaware multiturn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step enabling contextsensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the reasoning process the framework extends the grpo algorithm to accommodate complex multiturn interaction scenarios considering the training instability characteristics of mtir and the potential for significant deviation of model distribution from the initial model we enhance the grpo algorithm by adding a trajectory filtering mechanism and removing kl loss constraints experimental results demonstrate that mtirsql with parameters achieves textbf accuracy in the bird dev and execution accuracy in the spider dev significantly outperforming existing approaches multiobjective search mos has emerged as a unifying framework for planning and decisionmaking problems where multiple often conflicting criteria must be balanced while the problem has been studied for decades recent years have seen renewed interest in the topic across ai applications such as robotics transportation and operations research reflecting the reality that realworld systems rarely optimize a single measure this paper surveys developments in mos while highlighting crossdisciplinary opportunities and outlines open challenges that define the emerging frontier of mos in artificial intelligence ai alignment research instrumental goals also called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals are widely associated with advanced ai systems these goals which include tendencies such as powerseeking and selfpreservation become problematic when they conflict with human aims conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward hacking or goal misgeneralization and attempts to limit the symptoms of instrumental goals notably resource acquisition and selfpreservation this article proposes an alternative framing that a philosophical argument can be constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited drawing on aristotles ontology and its modern interpretations an ontology of concrete goaldirected entities it argues that advanced ai systems can be seen as artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct from their designers intentions in this view the instrumental tendencies of such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than accidental malfunctions the implication is that efforts should focus less on eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding managing and directing them toward humanaligned ends agentic ai represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence but its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding often conflating modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models a practice known as conceptual retrofitting this survey cuts through this confusion by introducing a novel dualparadigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two distinct lineages the symbolicclassical relying on algorithmic planning and persistent state and the neuralgenerative leveraging stochastic generation and promptdriven orchestration through a systematic prismabased review of studies we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around this framework across three dimensions the theoretical foundations and architectural principles defining each paradigm domainspecific implementations in healthcare finance and robotics demonstrating how application constraints dictate paradigm selection and paradigmspecific ethical and governance challenges revealing divergent risks and mitigation strategies our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic symbolic systems dominate safetycritical domains eg healthcare while neural systems prevail in adaptive datarich environments eg finance furthermore we identify critical research gaps including a significant deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for hybrid neurosymbolic architectures the findings culminate in a strategic roadmap arguing that the future of agentic ai lies not in the dominance of one paradigm but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both adaptable and reliable this work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to guide future research development and policy toward robust and trustworthy hybrid intelligent systems a core challenge of monte carlo tree search mcts is its sample efficiency which can be improved by grouping stateaction pairs and using their aggregate statistics instead of singlenode statistics on the go abstractions in upper confidence bounds applied to trees ogauct is the stateoftheart mcts abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its abstraction using the abstractions of stateaction pairs asap framework which aims to detect states and stateaction pairs with the same value under optimal play by analysing the search graph asap however requires two stateaction pairs to have the same immediate reward which is a rigid condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby the sample efficiency in this paper we break with the paradigm of grouping valueequivalent states or stateaction pairs and instead group states and stateaction pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference between their values can be inferred we call this abstraction framework known value difference abstractions kvda which infers the value differences by analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies ogauct to use this framework instead the modification is called kvdauct which detects significantly more abstractions than ogauct introduces no additional parameter and outperforms ogauct on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings autonomous agents powered by large language models llms have shown impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex tasksolving however existing paradigms such as react rely on sequential reasoning and execution failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent subtasks this sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multistep reasoning scenarios we introduce graphbased agent planning gap a novel framework that explicitly models intertask dependencies through graphbased planning to enable adaptive parallel and serial tool execution our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependencyaware subtask graphs autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies this dependencyaware orchestration achieves substantial improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy to train gap we construct a highquality dataset of graphbased planning traces derived from the multihop question answering mhqa benchmark we employ a twostage training strategy supervised finetuning sft on the curated dataset followed by reinforcement learning rl with a correctnessbased reward function on strategically sampled queries where toolbased reasoning provides maximum value experimental results on mhqa datasets demonstrate that gap significantly outperforms traditional react baselines particularly on multistep retrieval tasks while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization the project page is available at psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the complexity of multiple cooccurring disorders to address this we develop a novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record emr construction and multiagent diagnostic dialogue generation we create synthetic emrs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures clinical relevance and diversity our multiagent framework transfers the clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree supporting over diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards through this rigorous process we construct psycotalk the first largescale dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity containing multiturn diagnostic dialogues validated by psychiatrists this dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning offering a valuable resource for psychiatric comorbidity research compared to realworld clinical transcripts psycotalk exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length token distribution and diagnostic reasoning strategies licensed psychiatrists confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues this dataset enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multidisorder psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass event log data recording finegrained user actions and system events represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services however the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logscharacterized by large scale high dimensionality diverse data types and intricate temporal or relational structuresmake feature engineering extremely challenging existing automatic feature engineering approaches such as automl or genetic methods often suffer from limited explainability rigid predefined operations and poor adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data in this paper we propose fela feature engineering llm agents a multiagent evolutionary system that autonomously extracts meaningful and highperforming features from complex industrial event log data fela integrates the reasoning and coding capabilities of large language models llms with an insightguided selfevolution paradigm specifically fela employs specialized agentsidea agents code agents and critic agentsto collaboratively generate validate and implement novel feature ideas an evaluation agent summarizes feedback and updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dualmemory system to enable continual improvement moreover fela introduces an agentic evolution algorithm combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space extensive experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that fela can generate explainable domainrelevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort our results highlight the potential of llmbased multiagent systems as a general framework for automated interpretable and adaptive feature engineering in complex realworld environments reinforcement learning rl can refine the reasoning abilities of large language models llms but critically depends on a key prerequisite the llm can already generate highutility reasoning paths with nonnegligible probability for tasks beyond the llms current competence such reasoning path can be hard to sample and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal reasoning we are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that why is this the answer is often an easier question than what is the answer as it avoids the heavy cognitive load of openended exploration opting instead for explanatory reconstructionsystematically retracing the reasoning that links a question to its answer we show that llms can ilarly leverage answers to derive highquality reasoning paths we formalize this phenomenon and prove that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones building on this insight we introduce ravr referenceanswerguided variational reasoning an endtoend framework that uses answerconditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for questiononly reasoning experiments in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines we further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that ravr reduces hesitation strengthens conclusion consolidation and promotes problemspecific strategies in reasoning autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring significant social economic and environmental benefits however these benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines limiting the driving range of vehicles especially electric ones perception computing is typically the most powerintensive component as it relies on largescale deep learning models to extract environmental features recently numerous studies have employed model compression techniques such as sparsification quantization and distillation to reduce computational consumption however these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant drop in perception accuracy compared to highcomputation models to address these challenges we propose an energyefficient autonomous driving framework called enead in the adaptive perception module a perception optimization strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning firstly we manage multiple perception models with different computational consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically then we define them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on bayesian optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation while maintaining desired accuracy to adaptively switch the knob values in various traffic scenarios a lightweight classification model is proposed to distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios in the robust decision module we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of perturbed perception results extensive experiments evidence the superiority of our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance enead can reduce perception consumption by to and thus improve driving range by to agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that enhances reasoning collaboration and adaptive control enabling systems to coordinate and independently solve complex tasks we extend this paradigm to safety alignment by introducing agentic moderation a modelagnostic framework that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against jailbreak attacks unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications safe or unsafe our method integrates dynamic cooperative agents including shield responder evaluator and reflector to achieve contextaware and interpretable moderation extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative large visionlanguage models lvlms demonstrate that our approach reduces the attack success rate asr by maintains a stable nonfollowing rate nf and improves the refusal rate rr by achieving robust interpretable and wellbalanced safety performance by harnessing the flexibility and reasoning capacity of agentic architectures agentic moderation provides modular scalable and finegrained safety enforcement highlighting the broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety governance knowledge base question answering kbqa aims to answer naturallanguage questions over a structured knowledge base kb recent work improves kbqa by adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm in which large language models llms iteratively decompose a question generate its corresponding logical queries and interact with the kb to derive the answer however these methods typically finetune llms on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the agentic reasoning ability in this paper we propose knowcodera an llm that can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on kbs to obtain answers to incentivize autonomous exploration knowcodera trains the llm under outcomeonly supervision via a multistage curriculum reinforcement learning with an easytohard curriculum to establish foundational agentic capabilities knowcodera first finetunes the llm on a small set of highquality trajectories obtained through outcomebased rejection sampling then to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcomeonly supervision it applies multistage curriculum rl with reward schedules that progress from easy to hard trained with outcomeonly supervision knowcodera exhibits powerful reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets notably on the zeroshot subset of grailqa knowcodera achieves up to an relative improvement while using only onetwelfth of the training data demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex temporal dependencies heterogeneous modalities and dynamically evolving interstock relationships existing approaches often fail to unify structural semantic and regimeadaptive modeling within a scalable framework this work introduces hmssmoes a novel hypergraphbased multimodal architecture with llm reasoning and stylestructured mixture of experts integrating three key innovations a multicontext multimodal hypergraph that hierarchically captures finegrained spatiotemporal dynamics via a local context hypergraph lch and persistent interstock dependencies through a global context hypergraph gch employing shared crossmodal hyperedges and jensenshannon divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and crossmodal alignment a llmenhanced reasoning module which leverages a frozen large language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align quantitative and textual modalities enriching representations with domainspecific financial knowledge and a stylestructured mixture of experts ssmoes that combines shared market experts and industryspecialized experts each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regimeaware specialization under sparse activation extensive experiments on three major stock markets demonstrate that hmssmoes surpasses stateoftheart methods in both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance while exhibiting effective risk control datasets source code and model weights are available at our github repository reinforcement learning rlbased posttraining has been crucial for enabling multistep reasoning in large reasoning models lrms yet current reward schemes are typically outcomecentric we propose pmgrpo a reasoningaware group relative policy optimization grpo that augments standard answerformat rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure to this end process mining techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures how closely a policy models reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher model the empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that pmgrpo significantly outperforms existing methodologies for grpobased posttraining these results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoningaware grpo effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models large language models llms enable dynamic game interactions but fail to follow essential procedural flows in rulegoverned trading systems eroding player trust this work resolves the core tension between the creative flexibility of llms and the procedural demands of ingame trading browseofferreviewconfirm to this end autoregressive statetracking prompting astp is introduced a methodology centered on a strategically orchestrated prompt that compels an llm to make its statetracking process explicit and verifiable instead of relying on implicit contextual understanding astp tasks the llm with identifying and reporting a predefined state

dialogues demonstrates state compliance and calculation precision notably astp with placeholder postprocessing on smaller models geminiflash matches larger models geminipro performance while reducing response time from to establishing a practical foundation that satisfies both realtime requirements and resource constraints of commercial games evaluation and management em coding under the current procedural terminology cpt taxonomy documents medical services provided to patients by physicians used primarily for billing purposes it is in physicians best interest to provide accurate cpt em codes while important it is an auxiliary task that adds to physicians documentation burden automating this coding task will help alleviate physicians documentation burden improve billing efficiency and ultimately enable better patient care however a number of realworld complexities have made em encoding automation a challenging task in this paper we elaborate some of the key complexities and present profees our llmbased framework that tackles them followed by a systematic evaluation on an expertcurated realworld dataset profees achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than over a commercial cpt em coding system and almost over our strongest singleprompt baseline demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the realworld complexities most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic structural causal models scms ie directed acyclic graphs dags however many realworld systems eg biological systems contain feedback loops or cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity in this work we study counterfactual inference in cyclic scms under shiftscale interventions ie soft policystyle changes that rescale andor shift a variables mechanism using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards rlvr to optimize large language models llms can be conceptualized as progressively editing a querys reasoning tree this process involves exploring nodes tokens and dynamically modifying the models policy at each node when combined with data scheduling this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy however existing rlvr data scheduling methods typically rely on pathbased metrics to rank queries overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these queries in this paper we introduce a novel metric namely reasoning score rscore which measures the querys learning difficulty based on the structure of its reasoning tree based on the rscore we propose the reasoning tree schedule reschedule a scheduling algorithm that constructs a curriculum progressing from structurally ple high rscore to complex low rscore queries experiments on six mathreasoning benchmarks show that reschedule significantly improves average accuracy achieving gains of up to these strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and principled foundation for rlvr data scheduling we release gaperon a fully open suite of frenchenglishcoding language models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in largescale model training the gaperon family includes and parameter models trained on trillion tokens released with all elements of the training pipeline french and english datasets filtered with a neural quality classifier an efficient data curation and training framework and hundreds of intermediate checkpoints through this work we study how data filtering and contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance we find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence but yields subpar benchmark results and that late deliberate contamination continuing training on data mixes that include test sets recovers competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality we discuss how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage to support further research we also introduce harmless data poisoning during pretraining providing a realistic testbed for safety studies by openly releasing all models datasets code and checkpoints gaperon establishes a reproducible foundation for exploring the tradeoffs between data curation evaluation safety and openness in multilingual language model development while generative models especially large language models llms are ubiquitous in todays world principled mechanisms to assess their incorrectness are limited using the conformal prediction framework previous works construct sets of llm responses where the probability of including an incorrect response or error is capped at a desired userdefined tolerance level however since these methods are based on pvalues they are susceptible to phacking ie choosing the tolerance level posthoc can invalidate the guarantees we therefore leverage evalues to complement generative model outputs with escores as a measure of incorrectness in addition to achieving the same statistical guarantees as before escores provide users flexibility in adaptively choosing tolerance levels after observing the escores themselves by upper bounding a posthoc notion of error called size distortion we experimentally demonstrate their efficacy in assessing llm outputs for different correctness types mathematical factuality and property constraints satisfaction current evaluations of agents remain centered around oneshot task completion failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative nature of many realworld problems where human goals are often underspecified and evolve we argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion agents to developing collaborative agents assessed not only by the quality of their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort throughout the problemsolving process to support this shift we introduce collaborative effort scaling a framework that captures how an agents utility grows with increasing user involvement through case studies and ulated evaluations we show that stateoftheart agents often underperform in multiturn realworld scenarios revealing a missing ingredient in agent design the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and guiding development toward more effective interactions unlearning in large language models llms is crucial for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an open problem we investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual knowledge from deliberately unlearned llms across models ranging from to parameters optb llamab llamab llamab drawing from actr and hebbian theory spreading activation theories as well as communication principles we introduce stimulusknowledge entanglementbehavior framework skeb which models information entanglement via domain graphs and tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive framing we develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation patterns and evaluate factuality nonfactuality and hallucination in outputs our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall baseline vs with authority framing with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size recovery in vs in skeb provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness robustness and overall behavior in llms we introduce a method for efficiently solving initialboundary value problems ibvps that uses lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential equation pde exactly by construction by leveraging symmetry transformations the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from initial and boundary data as a result the loss directly measures the models accuracy leading to improved convergence moreover for wellposed ibvps our method enables rigorous error estimation the approach yields compact models facilitating an efficient optimization we implement liesolver and demonstrate its application to linear homogeneous pdes with a range of initial conditions showing that it is faster and more accurate than physicsinformed neural networks pinns overall our method improves both computational efficiency and the reliability of predictions for pdeconstrained problems a conditional latentdiffusion based framework for solving the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem associated with microwave imaging is introduced this generative machinelearning model explicitly mirrors the nonuniqueness of the illposed inverse problem unlike existing inverse solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a single reconstruction the proposed latentdiffusion model generates multiple plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scatteredfield data thereby generating several potential instances in the rangespace of the nonunique inverse mapping a forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into the reconstruction pipeline as a physicsbased evaluation mechanism the space of candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent with the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest scatteredfield data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered fields is reported as the final solution synthetic and experimental labeled datasets are used for training and evaluation of the model an innovative labeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of scattering features training of the model using this new dataset produces high quality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with excellent fidelity to shape recognition the results highlight the potential of hybrid generative physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust datadriven microwave imaging realworld language agents must handle complex multistep workflows across diverse apps for instance an agent may manage emails by coordinating with calendars and file systems or monitor a production database to detect anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual however existing language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or plified tasks that lack the diversity realism and longhorizon complexity required to evaluate agents realworld performance to address this gap we introduce the tool decathlon dubbed as toolathlon a benchmark for language agents offering diverse apps and tools realistic environment setup and reliable executionbased evaluation toolathlon spans software applications and tools ranging from everyday platforms such as google calendar and notion to professional ones like woocommerce kubernetes and bigquery most of the tools are based on a highquality set of model context protocol mcp servers that we may have revised or implemented ourselves unlike prior works which primarily ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity we provide realistic initial environment states from real software such as canvas courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets this benchmark includes manually sourced or crafted tasks in total requiring interacting with multiple apps over around turns on average to complete each task is strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts comprehensive evaluation of sota models highlights their significant shortcomings the bestperforming model claudesonnet achieves only a success rate with tool calling turns on average while the top openweights model deepseekvexp reaches we expect toolathlon to drive the development of more capable language agents for realworld longhorizon task execution large language modelbased agents show promise for software engineering but environment configuration remains a bottleneck due to heavy manual effort and scarce largescale highquality datasets existing benchmarks assess only endtoend buildtest success obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail we introduce the environment configuration diagnosis benchmark encondabench which provides processlevel trajectory assessment of finegrained agent capabilities during environment setupplanning perceptiondriven error diagnosis feedbackdriven repair and action to execute final environment configuration our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting realistic readme errors and are validated in docker for scalable highquality evaluation encondabench combines processlevel analysis with endtoend executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates evaluations across stateoftheart llms and agent frameworks show that while agents can localize errors they struggle to translate feedback into effective corrections limiting endtoend performance to our knowledge encondabench is the first framework to provide processlevel internal capability assessment for environment configuration offering actionable insights for improving software engineering agents graph neural networks gnns have recently been explored as surrogate models for numerical ulations while their applications in computational fluid dynamics have been investigated little attention has been given to structural problems especially for dynamic cases to address this gap we introduce the graph networkbased structural ulator gnss a gnn framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems gnss follows the encodeprocessdecode paradigm typical of gnnbased machine learning models and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic ulations thanks to three key features i expressing node kinematics in nodefixed local frames which avoids catastrophic cancellation in finitedifference velocities ii employing a signaware regression loss which reduces phase errors in long rollouts and iii using a wavelengthinformed connectivity radius which optimizes graph construction we evaluate gnss on a case study involving a beam excited by a khz hanningmodulated pulse the results show that gnss accurately reproduces the physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions where existing gnns fail to converge or deliver meaningful predictions compared with explicit finite element baselines gnss achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity these findings demonstrate that localitypreserving gnns with physicsconsistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic wavedominated structural ulations programming assistants powered by large language models llms have become widely available with conversational assistants like chatgpt proving particularly accessible to less experienced programmers however the varied capabilities of these tools across model versions and the mixed availability of extensions that enable web search code execution or retrievalaugmented generation create opportunities for user misconceptions about what systems can and cannot do such misconceptions may lead to overreliance unproductive practices or insufficient quality control in llmassisted programming here we aim to characterize misconceptions that users of conversational llmbased assistants may have in programming contexts using a twophase approach we first brainstorm and catalog user misconceptions that may occur and then conduct a qualitative analysis to examine whether these conceptual issues surface in naturalistic pythonprogramming conversations with an llmbased chatbot drawn from an openly available dataset indeed we see evidence that some users have misplaced expectations about the availability of llmbased chatbot features like web access code execution or nontext output generation we also see potential evidence for deeper conceptual issues around the scope of information required to debug validate and optimize programs our findings reinforce the need for designing llmbased tools that more clearly communicate their programming capabilities to users we consider the problem of federated learning fl with graphstructured data distributed across multiple clients in particular we address the prevalent scenario of interconnected subgraphs where interconnections between clients significantly influence the learning process existing approaches suffer from critical limitations either requiring the exchange of sensitive node embeddings thereby posing privacy risks or relying on computationallyintensive steps which hinders scalability to tackle these challenges we propose fedlap a novel framework that leverages global structure information via laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to effectively capture internode dependencies while ensuring privacy and scalability we provide a formal analysis of the privacy of fedlap demonstrating that it preserves privacy notably fedlap is the first subgraph fl scheme with strong privacy guarantees extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that fedlap achieves competitive or superior utility compared to existing techniques longhorizon contactrich bimanual manipulation presents a significant challenge requiring complex coordination involving a mixture of parallel execution and sequential collaboration between arms in this paper we introduce a hierarchical framework that frames this challenge as an integrated skill planning scheduling problem going beyond purely sequential decisionmaking to support ultaneous skill invocation our approach is built upon a library of singlearm and bimanual primitive skills each trained using reinforcement learning rl in gpuaccelerated ulation we then train a transformerbased planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a highlevel scheduler ultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills as well as their continuous parameters we demonstrate that our method achieves higher success rates on complex contactrich tasks than endtoend rl approaches and produces more efficient coordinated behaviors than traditional sequentialonly planners modern language models lms exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities yet standard evaluations asize correctness while overlooking a key aspect of humanlike reasoning efficiency in realworld reasoning scenarios much of the available information is irrelevant and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions we propose a framework for assessing lm reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming introducing a ple method to align proofs written in natural language as generated by an lm with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference empirically we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem we find that current lms show marked accuracy declines under such conditions even with minimal domainconsistent distractions and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences the advent of large language models llms has revolutionized natural language processing yet their application in highstakes specialized domains like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources this issue is particularly critical for the persianspeaking muslim community where accuracy and trustworthiness are paramount existing retrievalaugmented generation rag systems relying on plistic singlepass pipelines fall short on complex multihop queries requiring multistep reasoning and evidence aggregation to address this gap we introduce farsiqa a novel endtoend system for faithful advanced question answering in the persian islamic domain farsiqa is built upon our innovative fairrag architecture a faithful adaptive iterative refinement framework for rag fairrag employs a dynamic selfcorrecting process it adaptively decomposes complex queries assesses evidence sufficiency and enters an iterative loop to generate subqueries progressively filling information gaps operating on a curated knowledge base of over one million authoritative islamic documents farsiqa demonstrates superior performance rigorous evaluation on the challenging islamicpcqa benchmark shows stateoftheart performance the system achieves a remarkable in negative rejection a point improvement over baselines and a high answer correctness score of our work establishes a new standard for persian islamic qa and validates that our iterative adaptive architecture is crucial for building faithful reliable ai systems in sensitive domains the growing success of visionlanguageaction vla models stems from the promise that pretrained visionlanguage models vlms can endow agents with transferable world knowledge and visionlanguage vl grounding laying a foundation for action models with broader generalization yet when these vlms are adapted to the action modality it remains unclear to what extent their original vl representations and knowledge are preserved in this work we conduct a systematic study of representation retention during vla finetuning showing that naive action finetuning leads to degradation of visual representations to characterize and measure these effects we probe vlas hidden representations and analyze attention maps further we design a set of targeted tasks and methods that contrast vla models with their counterpart vlms isolating changes in vl capabilities induced by action finetuning we further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and introduce a ple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields improved generalization to outofdistribution ood scenarios taken together our analysis clarifies the tradeoff between action finetuning and the degradation of vl representations and highlights practical approaches to recover inherited vl capabilities code is publicly available we introduce boltgan a ple yet effective modification of the wgan framework inspired by the bayes optimal learning threshold bolt we show that with a lipschitz continuous discriminator boltgan implicitly minimizes a different metric distance than the earth mover wasserstein distance and achieves better training stability empirical evaluations on four standard image generation benchmarks cifar celeba lsun bedroom and lsun church show that boltgan consistently outperforms wgan achieving lower frechet inception distance fid our results suggest that bolt is a broadly applicable principle for enhancing gan training modern ai hardware such as nvidias blackwell architecture is increasingly embracing lowprecision floatingpoint fp formats to handle the pervasive activation outliers in large language models llms despite this industry trend a unified comparison of fp and integer int quantization across varying granularities has been missing leaving algorithm and hardware codesign without clear guidance this paper fills that gap by systematically investigating the tradeoffs between fp and int formats we reveal a critical performance crossover while fp excels in coarsegrained quantization the comparison at finegrained blockwise levels is more nuanced our comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular bit finegrained formats eg mx with block size mxint is superior to its fp counterpart in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency however for bit formats fp eg mxfp nvfp often holds an accuracy advantage though we show that nvint can surpass nvfp when outliermitigation techniques like hadamard rotation are applied we also introduce a symmetric clipping method that resolves gradient bias in finegrained lowbit int training enabling nearly lossless performance for mxint training these findings challenge the current hardware trajectory demonstrating that a onesizefitsall fp approach is suboptimal and advocating that finegrained int formats particularly mxint offer a better balance of accuracy power and efficiency for future ai accelerators while large language model llm agents are often approached from the angle of action planninggeneration to accomplish a goal eg given by language descriptions their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a joint goal are not well explored to address this limitation this paper studies llm agents in task collaboration particularly under the condition of information asymmetry where agents have disparities in their knowledge and skills and need to work together to complete a shared task we extend einstein puzzles a classical symbolic puzzle to a tabletop game in this game two llm agents must reason communicate and act to satisfy spatial and relational constraints required to solve the puzzle we apply a finetuningplusverifier framework in which llm agents are equipped with various communication strategies and verification signals from the environment empirical results highlight the critical importance of aligned communication especially when agents possess both informationseeking and providing capabilities interestingly agents without communication can still achieve high task performance however further analysis reveals a lack of true rule understanding and lower trust from human evaluators instead by integrating an environmentbased verifier we enhance agents ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration in ai systems recently instructionbased image editing iie has received widespread attention in practice iie often modifies only specific regions of an image while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged although these two types of regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational redundancy existing iie models do not account for this distinction instead applying a uniform generation process across the entire image this motivates us to propose regione an adaptive regionaware generation framework that accelerates iie tasks without additional training specifically the regione framework consists of three main components adaptive region partition we observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight allowing for multistep denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step therefore in the early denoising stages we partition the image into edited and unedited regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the reference image regionaware generation after distinguishing the regions we replace multistep denoising with onestep prediction for unedited areas for edited regions the trajectory is curved requiring local iterative denoising to improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation we propose the regioninstruction kv cache which reduces computational cost while incorporating global information adaptive velocity decay cache observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity ilarity we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate the local denoising process we applied regione to stateoftheart iie base models including stepxedit flux kontext and qwenimageedit regione achieved acceleration factors of and evaluations by gpto confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved recent advances in speech foundation models sfms have enabled the direct processing of spoken language from raw audio bypassing intermediate textual representations this capability allows sfms to be exposed to and potentially respond to rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal one underexplored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice these phonation types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state stance and social meaning in speech existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely rely on multiplechoice question answering mcqa formats which are prone to failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic features influence model behaviour in this paper we probe sfms through openended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition evaluating whether model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs we introduce a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality designed to evaluate sfm responses to creaky and breathy voice our work provides the first examination of sfm sensitivity to these particular nonlexical aspects of speech perception the accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for understanding climate change managing marine resources and optimizing maritime

ocean prediction accuracy supporting decisionmaking in environmental and economic sectors we present a hybrid quantumclassical recurrent neural network qrnn architecture in which the entire recurrent

a limiting case to obtain midcircuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum memory we further devise a soft attention mechanism over the midcircuit readouts in a sequencetosequence model and show its effectiveness for machine translation to our knowledge this is the first model rnn or otherwise grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequencelearning tasks we present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools and documents to enhance exemplar artifact generation our method begins by constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemasincluding descriptions arguments and output payloads using a deepresearchinspired analysis in parallel we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and sops which is then fused with the tool graph to generate exemplar plans we adopt a deepsparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool dependencies with procedural knowledge experiments demonstrate that this unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan generation underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain knowledge graphs for toolaugmented reasoning and planning agentic tool use has gained traction with the rise of agentic tool calling yet most existing work overlooks the complexity of multiturn tool interactions we introduce orchdag a synthetic data generation pipeline that models tool execution as directed acyclic graphs dags with controllable complexity using this dataset we benchmark model performance and propose a graphbased reward to enhance rlvr training experiments show that the dataset presents a challenging but solvable benchmark and the proposed reward is effective when combined with grpostyle algorithms highlighting the importance of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multiturn tool use sitespecific disease management ssdm in

visit to submit papers code or datasets function calling fc empowers large language models llms and autonomous agents to interface with external tools a critical capability for solving complex realworld problems as this ability becomes increasingly central to advanced ai systems the need for highquality multiturn training data to develop and refine it cannot be overstated existing data synthesis methods such as random environment sampling or multiagent roleplaying are not powerful enough to generate highquality data in realworld environments practical challenges come in three folds targeted model training isolation of tool architecture and multiturn logical dependency to address these structural deficiencies we present funreasonmt a novel data synthesis framework for realworld

a model built upon funreasonmt generated data achieves stateoftheart performance among comparablesized models outperforming most closesource models further performance improvements on bfclv confirm that funreasonmt provides a reliable and robust source for agentic learning generative artificial intelligence genai is taking the world by storm it promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing practices including healthcare from large language models llms for clinical note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that integrate medical imaging electronic health records and genomic data for decision support genai is transforming the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare such as diagnosis and personalized treatments with great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians thereby improving overall healthcare delivery however genai deployment in healthcare requires an indepth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot be achieved in this paper we propose a datacentric paradigm in the design and deployment of genai systems for healthcare specifically we reposition the data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational substrate for generative healthcare systems this ecosystem is designed to sustainably support the integration representation and retrieval of diverse medical data and knowledge with effective and efficient data processing pipelines such as semantic vector search and contextual querying it enables genaipowered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical applications ultimately it not only supplies foundation models with highquality multimodal data for largescale pretraining and domainspecific finetuning but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support taskspecific inference via the agentic layer the ecosystem enables the deployment of genai for highquality and effective healthcare delivery the capability of incontext learning icl enables large language models llms to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a few inputoutput examples however collecting highquality examples for new or challenging tasks can be costly and laborintensive in this work we propose a costefficient twostage pipeline that reduces reliance on llms for data labeling our approach first leverages readily available crosstask examples to prompt an llm and pseudolabel a small set of target task instances we then introduce a graphbased label propagation method that spreads label information to the remaining target examples without additional llm queries the resulting fully pseudolabeled dataset is used to construct intask demonstrations for icl this pipeline combines the flexibility of crosstask supervision with the scalability of llmfree propagation experiments across five tasks demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energyconstrained robotics by achieving ordersofmagnitude efficiency gains while enabling native temporal processing spiking neural networks snns represent a promising algorithmic approach for these systems yet their application to complex control tasks faces two critical challenges the nondifferentiable nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear optimization properties and the stateful dynamics of snns require training on sequences which in reinforcement learning rl is hindered by limited sequence lengths during early training preventing the network from bridging its warmup period we address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient slope settings showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients in supervised learning we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes the effect is much more pronounced in rl settings where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead to a improvement in both training and final deployed performance next we propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to bootstrap the learning process while still exploiting online environment interactions with the spiking policy combining our method with an adaptive slope schedule for a realworld drone position control task we achieve an average return of points substantially outperforming prior techniques including behavioral cloning and tdbc which achieve at most points under the same conditions this work advances both the theoretical understanding of surrogate gradient learning in snns and practical training methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in realworld robotic systems the autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that defines their digital environment such as the document object model dom of web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services however constructing this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges the verbosity of raw html makes it computationally intractable for direct use by foundation models while the static nature of hardcoded api integrations prevents agents from adapting to evolving services this paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured data presenting two complementary architectural patterns the dom transduction pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling a verbose raw dom into a compact taskrelevant representation or world model optimized for an agents reasoning core concurrently the hypermedia affordances recognition pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime together these patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently construct and maintain an accurate world model enabling scalable adaptive and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources since realworld legal experiments are often costly or infeasible ulating legal societies with artificial intelligence ai systems provides an effective alternative for verifying and developing legal theory as well as supporting legal administration large language models llms with their world knowledge and roleplaying capabilities are strong candidates to serve as the foundation for legal society ulation however the application of llms to ulate legal systems remains underexplored in this work we introduce law in silico an llmbased agent framework for ulating legal scenarios with individual decisionmaking and institutional mechanisms of legislation adjudication and enforcement our experiments which compare ulated crime rates with realworld data demonstrate that llmbased agents can largely reproduce macrolevel crime trends and provide insights that align with realworld observations at the same time microlevel ulations reveal that a wellfunctioning transparent and adaptive legal system offers better protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals evaluating reasoning ability in large language models llms is important for advancing artificial intelligence as it transcends mere linguistic task performance it involves understanding whether these models truly understand information perform inferences and are able to draw conclusions in a logical and valid way this study compare logical and abstract reasoning skills of several llms including gpt claude deepseek gemini grok llama mistral perplexity and sabi using a set of eight customdesigned reasoning questions the llm results are benchmarked against human performance on the same tasks revealing significant differences and indicating areas where llms struggle with deduction computerusing agents powered by visionlanguage models vlms have demonstrated humanlike capabilities in operating digital environments like mobile platforms while these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation their potential for unsafe operations such as system compromise and privacy leakage is raising significant concerns detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored to establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research we introduce mobilerisklive a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with finegrained annotations built upon this we propose ossentinel a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a formal verifier for detecting explicit systemlevel violations with a vlmbased contextual judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions experiments show that ossentinel achieves improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents with the rapid development of llmbased agents there is a growing trend to incorporate agentspecific data into the pretraining stage of llms aiming to better align llms with realworld autonomous task execution however current pretraining benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills eg common knowledge or mathematicalcode reasoning and fail to reflect models agentic capabilities on the other hand agent benchmarks are typically designed for posttrained models requiring multiturn task execution abilities that base models struggle to support thus there is a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pretraining and guide the model training more effectively to address this gap we propose aptbench a framework that converts realworld agent tasks and successful trajectories into multiplechoice or text completion questions tailored for base models it focuses on core agentic abilities eg planning and action and covers key agent scenarios software engineering and deep research compared to existing generalpurpose benchmarks aptbench offers a more predictive signal of a models downstream performance as an agent while remaining significantly more lightweight and costeffective than fullscale endtoend agent evaluations after posttraining the integration of large language models llms into realtime web applications such as aipowered search and conversational agents presents a fundamental web infrastructure challenge reconciling the demand for highquality complex reasoning with the stringent lowlatency and highthroughput requirements of interactive services current llm reasoning hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid reasoning strategies creates a critical bottleneck for the web services existing approaches typically optimize the llm reasoning for either efficiency or quality but struggle to achieve both and thus fail to meet the dual requirements of modern web platforms to overcome these limitations we propose orion a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependencyaware query decomposition and logicparallel content expansion concretely orion decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases key point generation which distills logically structured key points through retrievalaugmented fewshot prompting and content parallel expansion which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a dependency graph to ensure logical consistency furthermore orion introduces a pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational characteristics of the two phases generation imposes pressure on gpu computing and expansion stresses on gpu memory across multiple queries enabling crossquery parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance ie efficiency and quality experiments on diverse benchmarks show that orion not only delivers up to higher token generation speed and lower answer latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to through explicitly modeling interpoint dependencies policy cards are introduced as a machinereadable deploymentlayer standard for expressing operational regulatory and ethical constraints for ai agents the policy card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required constraints at runtime it tells the agent what it must and must not do as such it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent policy cards extend existing transparency artifacts such as model data and system cards by defining a normative layer that encodes allowdeny rules obligations evidentiary requirements and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks including nist ai rmf isoiec and the eu ai act each policy card can be validated automatically versioncontrolled and linked to runtime enforcement or continuousaudit pipelines the framework enables verifiable compliance for autonomous agents forming a foundation for distributed assurance in multiagent ecosystems policy cards provide a practical mechanism for integrating highlevel governance with handson engineering practice and enabling accountable autonomy at scale artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient by minimizing error across large datasets most systems deliver strong aggregate accuracy yet falter at the margins patients with rare variants multimorbidity or underrepresented demographics this average patient fallacy erodes both equity and trust we propose a different design a multiagent ecosystem for nof decision support in this environment agents clustered by organ systems patient populations and analytic modalities draw on a shared library of models and evidence synthesis tools their results converge in a coordination layer that weighs reliability uncertainty and data density before presenting the clinician with a decisionsupport packet risk estimates bounded by confidence ranges outlier flags and linked evidence validation shifts from population averages to individual reliability measured by error in lowdensity regions calibration in the small and riskcoverage tradeoffs anticipated challenges include computational demands automation bias and regulatory fit addressed through caching strategies consensus checks and adaptive trial frameworks by moving from monolithic models to orchestrated intelligence this approach seeks to align medical ai with the first principle of medicine care that is transparent equitable and centered on the individual for decades neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared ambition to understand intelligence and build it modern artificial neural networks now rival humans in language perception and reasoning yet it is still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as the brain does existing brainai alignment studies have shown the striking correspondence between the two systems but such comparisons remain bound to specific inputs and tasks offering no common ground for comparing how ai models with different kinds of modalitiesvision language or multimodalare intrinsically organized here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of brainlike space a unified geometric space in which every ai model can be precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks regardless of input modality task or sensory domain our extensive analysis of transformerbased models spanning stateoftheart large vision models large language models and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous arcshaped geometry within this space reflecting a gradual increase of brainlikeness different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within this geometry associated with different degrees of brainlikeness shaped not merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm asizes global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme facilitates deep fusion across different modalities moreover the degree of brainlikeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not identical twins the brainlike space provides the first unified framework for situating quantifying and comparing intelligence across domains revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the brain large language models llms become increasingly integrated into data science workflows for automated system design however these llmdriven data science systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of llms lacking guidance from scientific and theoretical principles this limits their trustworthiness and robustness especially when dealing with noisy and complex realworld datasets this paper provides vdsagents a multiagent system grounded in the predictabilitycomputabilitystability pcs principles proposed in the veridical data science vds framework guided by pcs principles the system implements a modular workflow for data cleaning feature engineering modeling and evaluation each phase is handled by an elegant agent incorporating perturbation analysis unit testing and model validation to ensure both functionality and scientific auditability we evaluate vdsagents on nine datasets with diverse characteristics comparing it with stateoftheart endtoend data science systems such as autokaggle and datainterpreter using deepseekv and gpto as backends vdsagents consistently outperforms the results of autokaggle and datainterpreter which validates the feasibility of embedding pcs principles into llmdriven data science automation generative large language models gllms such as chatgpt are increasingly being used in communication research for content analysis studies show that gllms can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders such as research assistants on various coding tasks relevant to communication science often at a fraction of the time and cost additionally gllms can decode implicit meanings and contextual information be instructed using natural language deployed with only basic programming skills and require little to no annotated data beyond a validation dataset constituting a paradigm shift in automated content analysis despite their potential the integration of gllms into the methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped in gllmassisted quantitative content analysis researchers must address at least seven critical challenges that impact result quality codebook development prompt engineering model selection parameter tuning iterative refinement validation of the models reliability and optionally performance enhancement this paper synthesizes emerging research on gllmassisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a comprehensive bestpractice guide to navigate these challenges our goal is to make gllmbased content analysis more accessible to a broader range of communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary quality standards of validity reliability reproducibility and research ethics judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events based on human judgment this task can be seen as a form of claim verification where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the plausibility of that event in this paper we propose a novel multiagent framework for claim verification whereby different agents may disagree on claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks qbafs we then instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification with a variety of agents realised with large language models llms argllm agents an existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates qbafs rbam agents whereby llmempowered relationbased argument mining rbam from external sources is used to generate qbafs ragargllm agents extending argllm agents with a form of retrievalaugmented generation rag of arguments from external sources finally we conduct experiments with two standard judgmental forecasting datasets with instances of our framework with two or three agents empowered by six different base llms we observe that combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy especially in the case of three agents while providing an explainable combination of evidence for claim verification despite the strong reasoning ability of large language modelsllms they are prone to errors and hallucinations as a result how to check their outputs effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their applications existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources such as trained verifiers eg processoutcome reward models or elaborate prompts which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to specific domains in this paper we investigate whether the internal behaviors of llms have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths specifically we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning correctness different from other correctness indicators for llms the calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the llm itself which avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated prompts based on it we design a ple plugandplay selfindicator method to reweight candidate reasoning paths which achieves significant performance improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few computational overhead our experiments across multiple llms of varying scales and model families have further shown the effectiveness of selfindicator it achieves over accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from incorrect ones and in turn improves the accuracies on three reasoning benchmarks by more than one weakness of monte carlo tree search mcts is its sample efficiency which can be addressed by building and using state andor action abstractions in parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of the same layer the primary usage of abstractions for mcts is to enhance the upper confidence bound ucb value during the tree policy by aggregating visits and returns of an abstract node however this direct usage of abstractions does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent might be in the same abstract node as these would then all have the same ucb value thus requiring a tiebreak rule in stateoftheart abstraction algorithms such as pruned on the go abstractions pruned oga this case has not been noticed and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen in this paper we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative intraabstraction policies several of which outperform the random policy across a majority of environments and parameter settings large language models llms increasingly rely on external tools to perform complex realistic tasks yet their ability to utilize the rapidly expanding model contextual protocol mcp ecosystem remains limited existing mcp research covers few servers depends on costly manual curation and lacks training support hindering progress toward realworld deployment to overcome these limitations we introduce mcpflow an automated webagentdriven pipeline for largescale server discovery data synthesis and model training mcpflow collects and filters data from servers and tools producing highquality instructionfunction call pairs and trajectories far exceeding prior work in scale and diversity extensive experiments demonstrate mcpflows effectiveness in driving superior mcp tool selection functioncall generation and enhanced agentic task performance mcpflow thus provides a scalable foundation for advancing llm agents proficiency in realworld mcp environments mcpflow is publicly available at href the rapid progress of large language models llms and their multimodal extensions mllms has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting across diverse environments a challenging yet impactful frontier is the development of gui agents which must navigate complex desktop and web interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization existing paradigms typically model tasks as longchain executions concatenating historical trajectories into the context while approaches such as mirage and gta refine planning or introduce multibranch action selection they remain constrained by two persistent issues dependence on historical trajectories which amplifies error propagation and local exploration bias where decisionfirst observationlater mechanisms overlook critical interface cues we introduce the memorydriven gui agent mga which reframes gui interaction around the principle of observe first then decide mga models each step as an independent contextrich environment state represented by a triad current screenshot taskagnostic spatial information and a dynamically updated structured memory experiments on osworld benchmarks real desktop applications chrome vscode vlc and crosstask transfer demonstrate that mga achieves substantial gains in robustness generalization and efficiency

driving efficiency while deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities existing methods remain confined to singledataset training limiting their robustness in planning through systematic analysis we discover that vehicular trajectory distributions and historyfuture correlations demonstrate remarkable consistency across different datasets based on these findings we propose uniplanner the first planning framework designed for multidataset integration in autonomous vehicle decisionmaking uniplanner achieves unified crossdataset learning through three synergistic innovations first the historyfuture trajectory dictionary network hftdn aggregates historyfuture trajectory pairs from multiple datasets using historical trajectory ilarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate crossdataset planning guidance second the gradientfree trajectory mapper gftm learns robust historyfuture correlations from multiple datasets transforming historical trajectories into universal planning priors its gradientfree design ensures the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning making the planning knowledge safely transferable third the sparsetodense sd paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors during training for robust learning while enabling full prior utilization during inference to maximize planning performance multimodal large language models mllms have advanced visionlanguage reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents however significant limitations remain mllms generalize poorly across digitalphysical spaces and embodiments visionlanguageaction models vlas produce lowlevel actions yet lack robust highlevel embodied reasoning and most embodied large language models ellms are constrained to digitalspace with poor generalization to the physical world thus unified models that operate seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across embodiments and tasks remain absent we introduce the boundless large model blm a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves instruction following and reasoning incorporates embodied knowledge and supports robust crossembodiment control blm integrates three key capabilities crossspace transfer crosstask learning and crossembodiment generalization via a twostage training paradigm stage i injects embodied knowledge into the mllm through curated digital corpora while maintaining language competence stage ii trains a policy module through an intentbridging interface that extracts highlevel semantics from the mllm to guide control without finetuning the mllm backbone this process is supported by a selfcollected crossembodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks evaluations across digital and physical benchmarks show that a single blm instance outperforms four model families mllms ellms vlas and gmlms achieving simtextbf gains in digital tasks and simtextbf in physical tasks building trainingready multihop question answering qa datasets that truly stress a models retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging recently while there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture the characteristics of hardtosearch but easytoverify problems requiring the integration of ambiguous indirect and crossdomain cues these data resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation making them unsuitable for supervised finetuning sft or reinforcement learning rl meanwhile manually curating nontrivially retrievable questions where answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require multihop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence incurs prohibitive human costs and fails to scale creating a critical data bottleneck for training highcapability retrievalandreasoning agents to address this we present an automated framework for generating highdifficulty trainingready multihop questions from semistructured knowledge sources the system i grows diverse logically labeled evidence clusters through natural language inference nlibased relation typing and diversityaware expansion ii applies reverse question construction to compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their combination uniquely identifies the target entity and iii enforces quality with a twostep evaluation pipeline that combines multimodel consensus filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidencebased matching the result is a scalable process that yields complex retrievalresistant yet verifiable questions suitable for sftrl training as well as challenging evaluation substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks incident management im is central to the reliability of largescale cloud systems yet manual im where oncall engineers examine metrics logs and traces is laborintensive and errorprone in the face of massive and heterogeneous observability data existing automated im approaches often struggle to generalize across systems provide limited interpretability and incur high deployment costs which hinders adoption in practice in this paper we present opsagent a lightweight selfevolving multiagent system for im that employs a trainingfree data processor to convert heterogeneous observability data into structured textual descriptions along with a multiagent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent and auditable to support continual capability growth opsagent also introduces a dual selfevolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with external experience accumulation thereby closing the deployment loop comprehensive experiments on the openrca benchmark demonstrate stateoftheart performance and show that opsagent is generalizable interpretable costefficient and selfevolving making it a practically deployable and sustainable solution for longterm operation in realworld cloud systems for doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence it cant be a black box they need to understand its reasoning almost as if they were consulting a colleague we created histolens to be that transparent collaborative partner it allows a pathologist to ply ask a question in plain english about a tissue slidejust as they would ask a trainee our system intelligently translates this question into a precise query for its ai engine which then provides a clear structured report but it doesnt stop there if a doctor ever asks why histolens can instantly provide a visual proof for any findinga heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the ai used for its analysis weve also ensured the ai focuses only on the patients tissue just like a trained pathologist would by teaching it to ignore distracting background noise the result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the expert in charge using a trustworthy ai assistant to verify their insights and make faster more confident diagnoses the increasing adoption of electric vehicles evs necessitates an understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop smart driving systems this study compares classical and machine learning models for ev car following behavior classical models include the intelligent driver model idm optimum velocity model ovm optimal velocity relative velocity ovrv and a plified cacc model while the machine learning approach employs a random forest regressor using a real world dataset of an ev following an internal combustion engine ice vehicle under varied driving conditions we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the rmse between predictions and real data the random forest model predicts acceleration using spacing speed and gap type as inputs results demonstrate the random forests superior accuracy achieving rmses of medium gap long gap and extra long gap among physics based models cacc performed best with an rmse of for long gaps these findings highlight the machine learning models performance across all scenarios such models are valuable for ulating ev behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy traffic dynamics in ev integrated environments system logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity supporting proactive breach prevention and postincident investigations however analyzing vast amounts of diverse log data remains significantly challenging as high costs lack of inhouse expertise and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for many organizations this study introduces llmloganalyzer a clusteringbased log analysis chatbot that leverages large language models llms and machine learning ml algorithms to plify and streamline log analysis processes this innovative approach addresses key llm limitations including context window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities enabling more effective summarization pattern extraction and anomaly detection tasks llmloganalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks results demonstrate significant performance improvements over stateoftheart llmbased chatbots including chatgpt chatpdf and notebooklm with consistent gains ranging from to across different tasks the system also exhibits strong robustness achieving a reduction in interquartile range iqr when using rouge scores indicating significantly lower result variability the frameworks effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a router log recognizer log parser and search tools this design enhances llm capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and robustness making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and nontechnical users crossdomain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web applications despite its rapid advancement achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge existing methods have made progress by extending singledomain models yet often fall short when facing domainspecific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns we argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components to address this we propose onecast a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components each modeled through tailored generative pathways specifically the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions in parallel the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semanticaware tokenizer and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism the outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domainspecific trends extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that onecast mostly outperforms stateoftheart baselines our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of large language models llms we focus on the singlemachine total tardiness smtt problem which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing jobs on a single processor without preemption given processing times and due dates we develop and benchmark two novel llmdiscovered heuristics the edd challenger eddc and mdd challenger mddc inspired by the wellknown earliest due date edd and modified due date mdd rules in contrast to prior studies that employed pler rulebased heuristics we evaluate our llmdiscovered algorithms using rigorous criteria including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixedinteger programming mip formulation of smtt we compare their performance against stateoftheart heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes and jobs for instances with more than jobs exact methods such as mip and dynamic programming become computationally intractable up to jobs eddc improves upon the classic edd rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature mddc consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches particularly on larger and more complex instances this study shows that humanllm collaboration can produce scalable highperforming heuristics for nphard constrained combinatorial optimization even under limited resources when effectively configured shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal changing demands for community resources however predicting such shifts before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons first measures are lacking for individuals heterogeneous social infrastructure resilience sir which directly influences their movement patterns and commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale eg sociodemographic characteristics second the complex interactions between individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently captured third individuallevel movement may be spatially sparse and not wellsuited to traditional decisionmaking methods for movement predictions this study incorporates individuals sir into a conditioned deep learning model to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and local spatial context using largescale sparse individuallevel data our experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals sir and spatial context can enhance the models ability to predict postevent individual movement patterns the conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement patterns among individuals who exhibit ilar preevent patterns but differ in sir traditional llm alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human preferences fitting a nave probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data say over promptcompletion pairs yields an inconsistent estimate of the populationaverage utility a canonical measure of social welfare we propose a new method dubbed the sign estimator that provides a ple provably consistent and efficient estimator by replacing crossentropy with binary classification loss in the aggregation step this ple modification recovers consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first polynomial finitesample error bounds in this setting in realistic ulations of llm alignment using digital twins the sign estimator substantially reduces preference distortion over a panel of ulated personas cutting angular estimation error by nearly and decreasing disagreement with true population preferences from to compared to standard rlhf our method also compares favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and require tracking individuallevel preference dataall while maintaining the implementation plicity of existing llm alignment pipelines we describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized framework for causal discovery using judo calculus which is formally defined as jstable causal inference using jdocalculus in a topos of sheaves in realworld applications from biology to medicine and social science causal effects depend on regime age country dose genotype or lab protocol our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence formally as local truth a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes not everywhere at once the lawveretierney modal operator chooses which regimes are relevant jstability means the claim holds constructively and consistently across that family we describe an algorithmic and implementation framework for judo calculus combining it with standard scorebased constraintbased and gradientbased causal discovery methods we describe experimental results on a range of domains from synthetic to realworld datasets from biology and economics our experimental results show the computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaftheoretic causal discovery as well as improved performance over classical causal discovery methods chainofthought cot reasoning is critical for improving the interpretability and reliability of large visionlanguage models lvlms however existing training algorithms such as sft ppo and grpo may not generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased reward model to address this challenge we reformulate reasoning in lvlms as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference by leveraging diversityseeking reinforcement learning algorithms we introduce a novel sparse reward function for tokenlevel learning signals that encourage diverse highlikelihood latent cot overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking additionally we implement a bayesian inferencescaling strategy that replaces costly bestofn and beam search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers we empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the stateoftheart lvlms on seven reasoning benchmarks in terms of effectiveness generalization and interpretability agentic ai systems powered by large language models llms and endowed with planning tool use memory and autonomy are emerging as powerful flexible platforms for automation their ability to autonomously execute tasks across web software and physical environments creates new and amplified security risks distinct from both traditional ai safety and conventional software security this survey outlines a taxonomy of threats specific to agentic ai reviews recent benchmarks and evaluation methodologies and discusses defense strategies from both technical and governance perspectives we synthesize current research and highlight open challenges aiming to support the development of securebydesign agent systems this work investigates the use of digital twins for dynamical system modeling and control integrating physicsbased datadriven and hybrid approaches with both traditional and aidriven controllers using a miniature greenhouse as a test platform four predictive models linear physicsbased modeling pbm long short term memory lstm and hybrid analysis and modeling ham are developed and compared under interpolation and extrapolation scenarios three control strategies model predictive control mpc reinforcement learning rl and large language model llm based control are also implemented to assess tradeoffs in precision adaptability and implementation effort results show that in modeling ham provides the most balanced performance across accuracy generalization and computational efficiency while lstm achieves high precision at greater resource cost among controllers mpc delivers robust and predictable performance rl demonstrates strong adaptability and llmbased controllers offer flexible humanai interaction when coupled with predictive tools while generative ai rapidly advances in various domains generating truly creative aesthetic and counterintuitive outputs remains a challenge this paper presents an approach to tackle these difficulties in the domain of chess puzzles we start by benchmarking generative ai architectures and then introduce an rl framework with novel rewards based on chess engine search statistics to overcome some of those shortcomings the rewards are designed to enhance a puzzles uniqueness counterintuitiveness diversity and realism our rl approach dramatically increases counterintuitive puzzle generation by from supervised to surpassing existing dataset rates and the best lichesstrained model our puzzles meet novelty and diversity benchmarks retain aesthetic themes and are rated by human experts as more creative enjoyable and counterintuitive than composed book puzzles even approaching classic compositions our final outcome is a curated booklet of these aigenerated puzzles which is acknowledged for creativity by three worldrenowned experts agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work but enterprises face a harder challenge moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver measurable business value this path is complicated by fragmented frameworks slow development and the absence of standardized evaluation practices generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction excelling on academic benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types applications and modalities yet evidence of their use in production enterprise settings remains limited this paper reports ibms experience developing and piloting the computer using generalist agent cuga which has been opensourced for the community cuga adopts a hierarchical plannerexecutor architecture with strong analytical foundations achieving stateoftheart performance on appworld and webarena beyond benchmarks it was evaluated in a pilot within the businessprocessoutsourcing talent acquisition domain addressing enterprise requirements for scalability auditability safety and governance to support assessment we introduce bpota a task benchmark spanning analytics endpoints in preliminary evaluations cuga approached the accuracy of specialized agents while indicating potential for reducing development time and cost our contribution is twofold presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at enterprise scale and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this initial pilot we outline requirements and next steps for advancing researchgrade architectures like cuga into robust enterpriseready systems coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under decentralized conditions is a longstanding challenge in robotics and artificial intelligence this work addresses the problem of decentralized goal assignment for multiagent path planning where agents independently generate ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the environment including grid visualizations and scenario data after this reasoning phase agents exchange their goal rankings and assignments are determined by a fixed deterministic conflictresolution rule eg agent index ordering without negotiation or iterative coordination we systematically compare greedy heuristics optimal assignment and large language model llmbased agents in fully observable gridworld settings our results show that llmbased agents when provided with welldesigned prompts and relevant quantitative information can achieve nearoptimal makespans and consistently outperform traditional heuristics these findings underscore the potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multiagent path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such systems longhorizon tasks requiring multistep reasoning and dynamic replanning remain challenging for large language models llms sequential prompting methods are prone to context drift loss of goal information and recurrent failure cycles while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken crosslevel continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead we introduce recap recursive contextaware reasoning and planning a hierarchical framework with shared context for reasoning and planning in llms recap combines three key mechanisms i planahead decomposition in which the model generates a full subtask list executes the first item and refines the remainder ii structured reinjection of parent plans maintaining consistent multilevel context during recursive return and iii memoryefficient execution bounding the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth together these mechanisms align highlevel goals with lowlevel actions reduce redundant prompting and preserve coherent context updates across recursion experiments demonstrate that recap substantially improves subgoal alignment and success rates on various longhorizon reasoning benchmarks achieving a gain on synchronous robotouille and a improvement on asynchronous robotouille under the strict pass protocol in nonmedical domains foundation models fms have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through largescale selfsupervised and multimodal learning consequently their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis prognostication and multimodal retrieval however recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses low diagnostic accuracy poor robustness geometric instability heavy computational demands and concerning safety vulnerabilities this short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream ai and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue seven interrelated causes are identified biological complexity ineffective selfsupervision overgeneralization excessive architectural complexity lack of domainspecific innovation insufficient data and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size these findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself the rapid advancement of generative ai has raised significant questions regarding its ability to produce creative and novel outputs our recent work investigates this question within the domain of chess puzzles and presents an ai system designed to generate puzzles characterized by aesthetic appeal novelty counterintuitive and unique solutions we briefly discuss our method below and refer the reader to the technical paper for more details to assess our systems creativity we presented a curated booklet of aigenerated puzzles to three worldrenowned experts international master for chess compositions amatzia avni grandmaster jonathan levitt and grandmaster matthew sadler all three are noted authors on chess aesthetics and the evolving role of computers in the game they were asked to select their favorites and explain what made them appealing considering qualities such as their creativity level of challenge or aesthetic design tandem mass spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in crucial fields such as metabolomics natural product discovery and environmental analysis however current methods rely on database matching from previously observed molecules or on multistep pipelines that require intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction this makes finding the correct molecule highly challenging particularly for compounds absent from reference databases we introduce a framework that by leveraging testtime tuning enhances the learning of a pretrained transformer model to address this gap enabling endtoend de novo molecular structure generation directly from the tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae bypassing manual annotations and intermediate steps we surpass the defacto stateoftheart approach diffms on two popular benchmarks nplib and massspecgym by and respectively testtime tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt to novel spectra and the relative performance gain over conventional finetuning is of on massspecgym when predictions deviate from the ground truth the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable identification multienvironment pomdps mepomdps extend standard pomdps with discrete model uncertainty mepomdps represent a finite set of pomdps that share the same state action and observation spaces but may arbitrarily vary in their transition observation and reward models such models arise for instance when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem the goal is to find a single policy that is robust against any choice of pomdp within the set ie a policy that maximizes the worstcase reward across all pomdps we generalize and expand on existing work in the following way first we show that mepomdps can be generalized to pomdps with sets of initial beliefs which we call adversarialbelief pomdps abpomdps second we show that any arbitrary mepomdp can be reduced to a mepomdp that only varies in its transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward functions while preserving optimal policies we then devise exact and imate pointbased algorithms to compute robust policies for abpomdps and thus mepomdps we demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard pomdp benchmarks extended to the multienvironment setting this paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in scientific problemsolving with a focus on its implications for disciplinary creativity drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity i distinguish between creative approaches and creative products and introduce the concept of disciplinary creativity the creative application of disciplinespecific expertise to a valued problem within that field through two cases in mathematics i show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity certain approaches involving ai can serve to displace it this displacement has the potential to alter and perhaps diminish the value of scientific pursuit we present gametars a generalist game agent trained with a unified scalable action space anchored to humanaligned native keyboardmouse inputs unlike api or guibased approaches this paradigm enables largescale continual pretraining across heterogeneous domains including os web and ulation games gametars is pretrained on over tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient sparsethinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost experiments show that gametars achieves about times the success rate over the previous sota model on openworld minecraft tasks is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web games and outperforms gpt geminipro and claudesonnet in fps benchmarks scaling results on trainingtime and testtime confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to crossgame and multimodal data our results demonstrate that ple scalable action representations combined with largescale pretraining provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computeruse abilities object binding the brains ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole is central to human cognition it groups lowlevel perceptual features into highlevel object representations stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory and supports human reasoning about individual object instances while prior work often imposes objectcentric attention eg slot attention explicitly to probe these benefits it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pretrained vision transformers vits intuitively they could recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention motivated by the quadratic nature of selfattention we hypothesize that vits represent whether two patches belong to the same object a property we term issameobject we decode issameobject from patch embeddings across vit layers using a ilarity probe which reaches over accuracy crucially this objectbinding capability emerges reliably in selfsupervised vits dino mae clip but markedly weaker in imagenetsupervised models suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives we further discover that issameobject is encoded in a lowdimensional subspace on top of object features and that this signal actively guides attention ablating issameobject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective our findings challenge the view that vits lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of which parts belong together emerges naturally in a connectionist system virtual reality vr games require players to translate highlevel semantic actions into precise device manipulations using controllers and headmounted displays hmds while humans intuitively perform this translation based on common sense and embodied understanding whether large language models llms can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored this paper introduces a benchmark combobench evaluating llms capability to translate semantic actions into vr device manipulation sequences across scenarios from four popular vr games halflife alyx into the radius moss book ii and vivecraft we evaluate seven llms including gpt gpt gpto geminipro llamab mixtralxb and glmflash compared against annotated ground truth and human performance our results reveal that while topperforming models like geminipro demonstrate strong task decomposition capabilities they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial understanding compared to humans performance varies significantly across games suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity fewshot examples substantially improve performance indicating potential for targeted enhancement of llms vr manipulation capabilities we release all materials at large language models llms have been shown to perform better when scaffolded into agents with memory tools and feedback beyond this selfevolving agents have emerged but current work largely limits adaptation to prompt rewriting or failure retries therefore we present alitag a selfevolution framework that transforms a generalpurpose agent into a domain expert by systematically generating abstracting and curating model context protocol mcp tools in this framework a generalist agent executes a curated suite of targetdomain tasks and synthesizes candidate mcps from successful trajectories these are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and consolidated into an mcp box at inference time alitag performs retrievalaugmented mcp selection with the help of each tools descriptions and use cases before executing an agent equipped with the mcp executor across several benchmarks gaia pathvqa and humanitys last exam alitag attains strong gains while reducing computation costs on gaia validation it achieves pass and pass establishing a new stateoftheart result while reducing mean tokens per example by imately relative to a strong baseline agent alitag thus provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable domainspecific competence improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks reinforcement learning rl has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models llms however the success of rl for llms heavily relies on humancurated datasets and verifiable rewards which limit their scalability and generality recent selfplay rl methods inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and go aim to enhance llm reasoning capabilities without humanannotated data however their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback eg a python interpreter or a game engine extending them to general domains remains challenging to address these challenges we propose multiagent evolve mae a framework that enables llms to selfevolve in solving diverse tasks including mathematics reasoning and general knowledge qa the core design of mae is based on a triplet of interacting agents proposer solver judge that are instantiated from a single llm and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors the proposer generates questions the solver attempts solutions and the judge evaluates both while coevolving experiments on qwenbinstruct demonstrate that mae achieves an average improvement of on multiple benchmarks these results highlight mae as a scalable dataefficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of llms with minimal reliance on humancurated supervision the rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence genai technologies has led many organizations to integrate ai into their products and services often without considering user preferences yet public attitudes toward ai use especially in impactful decisionmaking scenarios are underexplored using a largescale twowave survey study nwave nwave representative of the swiss population we examine shifts in public attitudes toward ai before and after the launch of chatgpt we find that the genai boom is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of ai see figure and increased demand for human oversight in various decisionmaking contexts the proportion of respondents finding ai not acceptable at all increased from to while support for humanonly decisionmaking rose from to these shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened educational linguistic and gender gaps postboom our findings challenge industry assumptions about public readiness for ai deployment and highlight the critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public preferences realworld tasks require decisions at varying granularities and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a highlevel form of action however current large language model llmbased agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities this limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between highlevel planning and lowlevel action which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization we propose recode recursive code generation a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation in this representation recode treats highlevel plans as abstract placeholder functions which the agent then recursively decomposes into finergrained subfunctions until reaching primitive actions this recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity furthermore the recursive structure inherently generates rich multigranularity training data enabling models to learn hierarchical decisionmaking processes extensive experiments show recode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control the code is available at as human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like industry a critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex human behaviors a research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic frameworks which often lack nuanced models of human behavior and descriptive behavioral ontologies which are not designed for real time collaborative interpretation this paper addresses this gap by presenting ontopret an ontology for the interpretation of human behavior grounded in cognitive science and a modular engineering methodology ontopret provides a formal machine processable framework for classifying behaviors including task deviations and deceptive actions we demonstrate its adaptability across two distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions the scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond textbased source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate this visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content generation and precise programdriven editing of visualizations however progress has been impeded by the scarcity of highquality multimodal code data a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment to address these challenges we make contributions from both a data and modeling perspective we first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a largescale highquality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex interactive web uis and codedriven animations leveraging this toolkit we construct januscodek the largest multimodal code corpus to date this powers the training of our models januscoder and januscoderv which establish a visualprogrammatic interface for generating code from textual instructions visual inputs or a combination of both our unified model is a departure from existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks extensive experiments on both textcentric and visioncentric coding tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the januscoder series with our to scale models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models furthermore extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing programmatic logic with its visual expression our code and checkpoints will are available at designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important and longstanding challenge in recent years a wide range of solutions have been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning including neurosymbolic approaches variants of the transformer architecture and specialised graph neural networks however existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly plified setting based on the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths in fact this assumption is hardbaked into the architecture of several recent models leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but are difficult to generalise to other settings to support further progress in the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks we introduce nora a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires models to go beyond pathbased reasoning the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence ai has led to unprecedented computational demands raising significant environmental and ethical concerns this paper critiques the prevailing reliance on largescale static datasets and monolithic training paradigms advocating for a shift toward humaninspired sustainable ai solutions we introduce a novel framework human ai hai which asizes incremental learning carbonaware optimization and humanintheloop collaboration to enhance adaptability efficiency and accountability by drawing parallels with biological cognition and leveraging dynamic architectures hai seeks to balance performance with ecological responsibility we detail the theoretical foundations system design and operational principles that enable ai to learn continuously and contextually while minimizing carbon footprints and human annotation costs our approach addresses pressing challenges in active learning continual adaptation and energyefficient model deployment offering a pathway toward responsible humancentered artificial intelligence the recent advancement of multimodal large language models mllms is transforming humancomputer interaction hci from surfacelevel exchanges into more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication to realize this shift emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent furthermore providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust however current mllmbased methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions this inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings to address this we propose a novel approach the emotional rationale verifier erv and an explanation reward our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired videodescription annotations our method significantly improves faithful explanationprediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the mafw and dfew datasets through extensive experiments and human evaluations we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers mllms to deliver emotionally coherent trustworthy interactions marking a key step toward truly humanlike hci systems this paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes of modern agentic ai systems and the abstract machines of the chomsky hierarchy we posit that the memory architecture of an ai agent is the definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly maps it to a corresponding class of automaton specifically we demonstrate that ple reflex agents are equivalent to finite automata hierarchical taskdecomposition agents are equivalent to pushdown automata and agents employing readablewritable memory for reflection are equivalent to tms this automataagent framework provides a principled methodology for rightsizing agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost more critically it creates a direct pathway to formal verification enables the application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety and predictability by classifying agents we can formally delineate the boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally undecidable we address the inherent probabilistic nature of llmbased agents by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative risk analysis the paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks ai predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans yet robust decisions under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current ai lacks domain knowledge not captured by data long horizon context and reasoning grounded in the physical world this gap has motivated growing efforts to design collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and ai this work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of human ai collaboration within uncertainty quantification a key component of reliable decision making we introduce human ai collaborative uncertainty quantification a framework that formalizes how an ai model can refine a human experts proposed prediction set with two goals avoiding counterfactual harm ensuring the ai does not degrade correct human judgments and complementarity enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed at the population level we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function extending a classical result in conformal prediction building on this insight we develop practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution free finite sample guarantees the online method adapts to distribution shifts including human behavior evolving through interaction with ai a phenomenon we call human to ai adaptation experiments across image classification regression and text based medical decision making show that collaborative prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone achieving higher coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege comply with regulations and remain auditable we present a policy aware controller that uses a large language model llm to interpret natural language requests against written policies and metadata not raw data the system implemented with google gemini flash executes a sixstage reasoning framework context interpretation user validation data classification business purpose test compliance mapping and risk synthesis with early hard policy gates and deny by default it returns approve deny conditional together with cited controls and a machine readable rationale we evaluate on fourteen canonical cases across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark results show exact decision match improving from to after applying policy gates deny recall rising to false approval rate on mustdeny families dropping to and functional appropriateness and compliance adherence at expert ratings of rationale quality are high and median latency is under one minute these findings indicate that policy constrained llm reasoning combined with explicit gates and audit trails can translate human readable policies into safe compliant and traceable machine decisions this work is a commentary of the article href ai survival stories a taxonomic analysis of ai existential risk by cappelen goldstein and hawthorne it is not just a commentary though but a useful reminder of the philosophical limitations of saylinear models of risk the article will focus on the model employed by the authors first i discuss some differences between standard swiss cheese models and this one i then argue that in a situation of epistemic indifference the probability of pd is higher than what one might first suggest given the structural relationships between layers i then distinguish between risk and uncertainty and argue that any estimation of pd is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty option uncertainty and statespace uncertainty incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into our qualitative discussion on ai existential risk can provide a better understanding of the likeliness of pd the growing intersection of cybersecurity and law creates a complex information space where traditional legal research tools struggle to deal with nuanced connections between cases statutes and technical vulnerabilities this knowledge divide hinders collaboration between legal experts and cybersecurity professionals to address this important gap this work provides a first step towards intelligent systems capable of navigating the increasingly intricate cyberlegal domain we demonstrate promising initial results on multilingual tasks deep networks dqn have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement learning tasks however their reliance on associative learning often leads to the acquisition of spurious correlations hindering their problemsolving capabilities in this paper we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal principles into dqns leveraging the peace probabilistic easy variational causal effect formula for estimating causal effects by incorporating causal reasoning during training our proposed framework enhances the dqns understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment thereby mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations we demonstrate that integrating dqns with causal capabilities significantly enhances their problemsolving capabilities without compromising performance experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our approach outperforms conventional dqns highlighting the effectiveness of causal reasoning in reinforcement learning overall our work presents a promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning agents through principled causal inference autobidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically providing bids for advertisers while previous work has made great efforts to model bidding environments for better ad performance it has limitations in generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored for specific bidding scenarios to this end we approach the scenarioindependent principles through a unified function that estimates the achieved effect under specific bids such as budget consumption gross merchandise volume gmv page views etc then we propose a bidding foundation model bidx to learn this fundamental function from data in various scenarios our bidx is built over uniform series embeddings that encode heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods to capture complex intervariable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data we propose two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation learning on top of the learned variable and temporal representations a variableaware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome prediction to model the unique bidding data distribution we devise a zeroinflated projection module to incorporate the estimated nonzero probability into its value prediction which makes up a joint optimization objective containing classification and regression the objective is proven to converge to the zeroinflated distribution our model has been deployed on the ad platform in taobao one of the worlds largest ecommerce platforms offline evaluation on eight

foundation model in computational advertising data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the efficient collection processing and delivery of realtime data supporting rapid data analysis in this paper we present autostreampipe a novel framework that employs large language models llms to automate the design generation and deployment of stream processing pipelines autostreampipe bridges the semantic gap between highlevel user intent and platformspecific implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured multiagent reasoning by integrating a hypergraph of thoughts hgot as an extended version of got autostreampipe combines resilient execution strategies advanced query analysis and hgot to deliver pipelines with good accuracy experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that autostreampipe significantly reduces development time and error rates as measured by a novel errorfree score efs compared to llm codegeneration methods opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers of our behaviors in current times due to growth of social networking website and increase in number of ecommerce site huge amount of opinions are now available on web given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions or sentiments about an entity opinion mining aims to extract attributes and components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to determine whether the comments are positive negative or neutral while lot of research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set classifying opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been done before in this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a deeper level of granularity is proposed this is done by using fuzzy logic reasoning after which entities are ranked as per this information adaptive agent design offers a way to improve humanai collaboration on timesensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments in such cases to ensure the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements an assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most effectively given that human attention represents a zerosum cognitive resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming information we introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication formalised as bayesian reference resolution using the rational speech act rsa modelling framework to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment the agent adapts message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based on projections of how priorguided interpretation of messages will influence attention to the interface and subsequent belief update across several timesteps out to a fixed horizon in a comparison to baseline methods we show that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multistep planning with a realistic model of user awareness as the first application of rsa for communication in a dynamic environment and for humanai interaction in general we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in humanagent teams highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents cnot gates are fundamental to quantum computing as they facilitate entanglement a crucial resource for quantum algorithms certain classes of quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from cnot gates given their widespread use it is imperative to minimise the number of cnot gates employed this problem known as cnot minimisation remains an open challenge with its computational complexity yet to be fully characterised in this work we introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task instead of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes we use a single agent up to a fixed size matrices of sizes different from are preprocessed using either embedding or gaussian striping to assess the efficacy of our approach we trained an agent with and evaluated it on matrices of size that range from to the results we obtained show that our method overperforms the stateoftheart algorithm as the value of increases recent advances in datadriven approaches such as neural operators nos have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated circuit ic thermal ulations however a limitation of these approaches is requiring a large amount of highfidelity training data such as chip parameters and temperature distributions thereby incurring significant computational costs to address this challenge we propose a novel algorithm for the generation of ic thermal ulation data named block krylov and operator action blockoa which ultaneously accelerates the data generation process and enhances the precision of generated data blockoa is specifically designed for ic applications initially we use the block krylov algorithm based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic solutions then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that satisfy the physical constraints finally we apply heat operators on these functions to determine the heat source distributions efficiently generating precise data points theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of blockoa is one order lower than the existing method experimental results further validate its efficiency showing that blockoa achieves a fold speedup in generating thermal ulation data for chips with varying physical parameters and ic structures even with just of the generation time datadriven approaches trained on the data generated by blockoa exhibits comparable performance to that using the existing method while several high profile video games have served as testbeds for deep reinforcement learning drl this technique has rarely been employed by the game industry for crafting authentic ai behaviors previous research focuses on training superhuman agents with large models which is impractical for game studios with limited resources aiming for humanlike agents this paper proposes a sampleefficient drl method tailored for training and finetuning agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry our method improves sample efficiency of valuebased drl by leveraging precollected data and increasing network plasticity we evaluate our method training a goalkeeper agent in ea sports fc one of the bestselling football ulations today our agent outperforms the games builtin ai by in ball saving rate ablation studies show that our method trains agents faster compared to standard drl methods finally qualitative evaluation from domain experts indicates that our approach creates more humanlike gameplay compared to handcrafted agents as a testament to the impact of the approach the method has been adopted for use in the most recent release of the series we introduce a novel dropin modification to monte carlo tree searchs mcts decision policy that we call aupo comparisons based on a range of ippc benchmark problems show that aupo clearly outperforms mcts aupo is an automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward distribution statistics acquired during the mcts thus unlike other automatic abstraction algorithms aupo requires neither access to transition probabilities nor does aupo require a directed acyclic search graph to build its abstraction allowing aupo to detect symmetric actions that stateoftheart frameworks like asap struggle with when the resulting symmetric states are far apart in state space furthermore as aupo only affects the decision policy it is not mutually exclusive with other abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search learning diverse skills without handcrafted reward functions could accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks however existing skill discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without considering human preferences which leads to undesirable behaviors and possibly dangerous skills for instance a cheetah robot trained using previous methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity whereas we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas in this work we propose a foundation model guided fog skill discovery method which incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models specifically fog extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate states based on human intentions assigning higher values to desirable states and lower to undesirable ones these scores are then used to reweight the rewards of skill discovery algorithms by optimizing the reweighted skill discovery rewards fog successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors such as flipping or rolling and to avoid hazardous areas in both statebased and pixelbased tasks interestingly we show that fog can discover skills involving behaviors that are difficult to define interactive visualisations are available from scientific large language models scillms have emerged as a promising frontier for accelerating biological discovery however these models face a fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences the tokenization dilemma whether treating sequences as a specialized language risking the loss of functional motif information or as a separate modality introducing formidable alignment challenges current strategies fundamentally limit their reasoning capacity we challenge this sequencecentric paradigm by positing that a more effective strategy is to provide scillms with highlevel structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools thereby bypassing the need to interpret lowlevel noisy sequence data directly through a systematic comparison of leading scillms on biological reasoning tasks we tested three input modes sequenceonly contextonly and a combination of both our findings are striking the contextonly approach consistently and substantially outperforms all other modes even more revealing the inclusion of the raw sequence alongside its highlevel context consistently degrades performance indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise even for models with specialized tokenization schemes these results suggest that the primary strength of existing scillms lies not in their nascent ability to interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch but in their profound capacity for reasoning over structured humanreadable knowledge therefore we argue for reframing scillms not as sequence decoders but as powerful reasoning engines over expert knowledge this work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid scientific ai agents repositioning the developmental focus from direct sequence interpretation towards highlevel knowledge synthesis the code is available at generating highquality code remains a challenge for large language models llms for the evolution of reasoning models on this task reward models are a necessary intermediate step these models judge outcomes or intermediate steps decoderonly transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing a regression layer and supervised finetuning while it is known that reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model we want to investigate whether stateoftheart small language models like the phi family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of process rewards and outcome rewards targeting this goal we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness labels derived from the apps coding challenge benchmark we then train a valuehead model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs our evaluation shows that small llms are capable of serving as effective reward models or code evaluation critics successfully identifying correct solutions among multiple candidates using this critic we achieve over a improvement in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence technology the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important component of the education industry cognitive diagnostic technology can utilize students learning data and feedback information in educational evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level however while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of disciplinary data in crossdisciplinary fields traditional cognitive diagnostic methods still face many challenges given the differences in knowledge systems cognitive structures and data characteristics between different disciplines this paper conducts indepth research on neural network cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive diagnosis and proposes an innovative crossdisciplinary cognitive diagnosis method tlcd this method combines deep learning techniques and transfer learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline the experimental results show that the crossdisciplinary cognitive diagnosis model based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in crossdisciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks and can more accurately evaluate students learning situation artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transition from a computational instrument to an autonomous originator of scientific knowledge this emerging paradigm the ai scientist is architected to emulate the complete scientific workflowfrom initial hypothesis generation to the final synthesis of publishable findingsthereby promising to fundamentally reshape the pace and scale of discovery however the rapid and unstructured proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape obscuring overarching methodological principles and developmental trends this survey provides a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of this domain by introducing a unified sixstage methodological framework that deconstructs the endtoend scientific process into literature review idea generation experimental preparation experimental execution scientific writing and paper generation through this analytical lens we chart the fields evolution from early foundational modules to integrated closedloop systems and finally to the current frontier of scalability impact and humanai collaboration present by rigorously synthesizing these developments this survey not only clarifies the current state of autonomous science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining challenges in robustness and governance ultimately guiding the next generation of systems toward becoming trustworthy and indispensable partners in human scientific inquiry recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparsestep planning over singlestep planning training models to skip steps in their trajectories helps capture longterm dependencies without additional or memory computational cost however predicting excessively sparse plans degrades performance we hypothesize this temporal density threshold is nonuniform across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should be more densely planned we propose mixed density diffuser mdd a diffusion planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters mdd achieves a new sota across the mazed franka kitchen and antmaze drl task domains large language models llms have demonstrated promising performance in generating diagnostic conclusions from imaging findings thereby supporting radiology reporting trainee education and quality control however systematic guidance on how to optimize prompt design across different clinical contexts remains underexplored moreover a comprehensive and standardized framework for assessing the trustworthiness of llmgenerated radiology reports is yet to be established this study aims to enhance the trustworthiness of llmgenerated liver mri reports by introducing a multidimensional credibility assessment mdca framework and providing guidance on institutionspecific prompt optimization the proposed framework is applied to evaluate and compare the performance of several advanced llms including kimikinstruct qwenbabinstruct deepseekv and

ratings across profiles barxge with domain experts at enabling efficient and trustworthy explanations recently semantically constrained adversarial examples semanticae which are directly generated from natural language instructions have become a promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms to generate semanticaes current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human instructions such as referring diversity descriptive incompleteness and boundary ambiguity have not been fully investigated to tackle the issues this paper develops a multidimensional instruction uncertainty reduction insur framework to generate more satisfactory semanticae ie transferable adaptive and effective specifically in the dimension of the sampling method we propose the residualdriven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language references by coarsely predicting the languageguided sampling process the optimization process will be stabilized by the designed resadvddim sampler therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of multistep diffusion models in task modeling we propose the contextencoded attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from incomplete human instructions guidance masking and renderer integration are proposed to regulate the constraints of dd semanticae activating stronger scenarioadapted attacks moreover in the dimension of generator evaluation we propose the semanticabstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by clarifying the evaluation boundary facilitating the development of more effective semanticae generators extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the transfer attack performance of insur moreover we realize the referencefree generation of semantically constrained adversarial examples for the first time in wireless communication systems efficient and adaptive resource allocation plays a crucial role in enhancing overall quality of service qos while centralized multiagent reinforcement learning marl frameworks rely on a central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling they suffer from scalability issues and privacy risks in contrast the distributed training with decentralized execution dtde paradigm enables distributed learning and decisionmaking but it struggles with nonstationarity and limited interagent cooperation which can severely degrade system performance to overcome these challenges we propose the multiagent conditional diffusion model planner macdmp for decentralized communication resource management built upon the modelbased reinforcement learning mbrl paradigm macdmp employs diffusion models dms to capture environment dynamics and plan future trajectories while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation thereby alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional dtde methods moreover to imate largescale agent interactions a meanfield mf mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in dms this design mitigates interagent nonstationarity and enhances cooperation with minimal communication overhead in distributed settings we further theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional imation error introduced by the mfbased diffusion generation guaranteeing convergence stability and reliable modeling of multiagent stochastic dynamics extensive experiments demonstrate that macdmp consistently outperforms existing marl baselines in terms of average reward and qos metrics showcasing its scalability and practicality for realworld wireless network optimization next pointofinterest poi recommendation is a critical task in modern locationbased social networks lbsns aiming to model the complex decisionmaking process of human mobility to provide personalized recommendations for a users next checkin location existing poi recommendation models predominantly based on graph neural networks and sequential models have been extensively studied however these models face a fundamental limitation they struggle to ultaneously capture the inherent hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts of userspecific temporal contexts to overcome this limitation we propose gtrmamba a novel framework for crossmanifold conditioning and routing gtrmamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces for different tasks it models the static treelike preference hierarchies in hyperbolic geometry while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient euclidean tangent space this process is coordinated by a crossmanifold channel that fuses spatiotemporal information to explicitly steer the state space model ssm enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes extensive experiments on three realworld datasets demonstrate that gtrmamba consistently outperforms stateoftheart baseline models in next poi recommendation generalization across agentic toolcalling environments remains a key unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems while large language models llms demonstrate strong performance on isolated benchmarks their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and coordinate tools across diverse domains is poorly understood in this work we conduct a largescale evaluation of stateoftheart llms on multiple toolcalling benchmarksbfcl taubench taubench and acebenchand introduce maven math physics adversarial verification evaluation network a new out of distribution ood benchmark designed to stresstest multistep reasoning through explicit verification and adversarial task composition our results show that most current models achieve below accuracy on maven revealing a significant generalization gap across tooluse settings to address this we present the corethink agentic reasoner a framework that augments llms with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration without additional training it generalizes across all benchmarks achieving stateoftheart performance with improvements over existing baselines at roughly onetenth the computational cost cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models for various inferential mechanisms categorization induction abduction causal inference contrast merge yet both natural and artificial views on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework this paper formulates a speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap to postulate on higherlevel activation processes from a material perspective we consider inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic ai modelling techniques through the plistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates we observe that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and negation compared to standard logic and logic programming then by combinatorial exploration we identify four main forms of dependencies that can be realized by these inferential circuits looking at how these forms are generally used in the context of logic programs we identify eight common inferential patterns exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in an unifying framework finally following a probabilistic interpretation of logic programs we unveil inner functional dependencies the paper concludes elaborating in what sense even if our arguments are mostly informed by symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures our observations may pinpoint to more generally applicable structures a cascaded online learning flight control system has been developed and enhanced with respect to action smoothness in this paper we investigate the convergence performance of the control system characterized by the increment of a lyapunov function candidate the derivation of this metric accounts for discretization errors and state prediction errors introduced by the incremental model comparative results are presented through flight control ulations multimodal large language models mllms have demonstrated strong capabilities on visionandlanguage tasks however recent findings reveal an imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities specifically current mllms often overrely on textual cues while underattending to visual content resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks that require genuine visual reasoning we refer to this phenomenon as the modality gap defined as the performance disparity between textcentric and visioncentric inputs in this paper we analyze the modality gap through the lens of training recipes we first show that existing training recipes tend to amplify this gap then we systematically explore strategies to bridge it from two complementary perspectives data and loss design our findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning our code is publicly available at while reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in many complex tasks they typically do not become more computationally efficient as they improve in contrast humans gradually require less cognitive effort as they become more proficient at a task if agents could reason about their compute as they learn could they ilarly reduce their computation footprint if they could we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute cycles for other processes like planning in this paper we experiment with showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to control when they use compute we conduct our experiments on the arcade learning environment and our results demonstrate that with the same training compute budget agents that reason about their compute perform better on of games furthermore these agents use three times less compute on average we analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies the hierarchical reasoning model hrm has impressive reasoning abilities given its small size but has only been applied to supervised static fullyobservable problems one of hrms strengths is its ability to adapt its computational effort to the difficulty of the problem however in its current form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous timesteps if the problem is dynamic uncertain or partially observable or be applied where the correct action is undefined characteristics of many realworld problems this paper presents hrmagent a variant of hrm trained using only reinforcement learning we show that hrm can learn to navigate to goals in dynamic and uncertain maze environments recent work suggests that hrms reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process we explore the dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is successfully reusing computation from earlier environment timesteps this article analyzes the existential risks artificial intelligence ai poses to humanity tracing the trajectory from current ai to ultraintelligence drawing on irving good and nick bostroms theoretical work plus recent publications ai if anyone builds it everyone dies it explores agi and superintelligence considering machines exponentially growing cognitive power and hypothetical iqs it addresses the ethical and existential implications of an intelligence vastly exceeding humanitys fundamentally alien human extinction may result not from malice but from uncontrollable indifferent cognitive superiority microsoft copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various agents skilled in handling important tasks ranging from assisting a customer with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming code each agent can be powered by language models software engineering operations such as database retrieval and internal external knowledge the repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents this requires a robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right agents in this work we propose an agentic metaorchestrator amo for handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services which can provide both natural language and action responses we will also demonstrate the planning that leverages metalearning ie a trained decision tree model for deciding the best inference strategy among various agentsmodels we showcase the effectiveness of our amo through two production use cases microsoft ecommerce copilot and code compliance copilot ecommerce copilot advertises microsoft products to external customers to promote sales success the ecommerce copilot provides uptodate product information and connects to multiple agents such as relational databases and human customer support the code compliance copilot scans the internal devops code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests pr ai agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work such as software engineering and professional writing signaling a pressing trend with significant impacts on the human workforce however these agent developments have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute work to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in diverse workflows in this work we study how agents do human work by presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across multiple essential workrelated skills data analysis engineering computation writing and design to better understand and compare heterogeneous computeruse activities of workers we introduce a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable structured workflows from either human or agent computeruse activities using such induced workflows we compare how humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that while agents exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows they take an overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains even for openended visually dependent tasks like design creating a contrast with the uicentric methods typically used by humans agents produce work of inferior quality yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and misuse of advanced tools nonetheless agents deliver results faster and cost less than humans highlighting the potential for enabling efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents the rapid development of visionlanguage models vlms enables openended perception and reasoning recent works have started to investigate how to adapt generalpurpose vlms into personalized assistants even commercial models such as chatgpt now support model personalization by incorporating userspecific information however existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or train a vlm to utilize userspecific information however both pipelines struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants we introduce jarvis an innovative framework for a personalized ai assistant through personal kvcache retrieval which stores userspecific information in the kvcaches of both textual and visual tokens the textual tokens are created by summarizing user information into metadata while the visual tokens are produced by extracting distinct image patches from the users images when answering a question jarvis first retrieves related kvcaches from personal storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses we also introduce a finegrained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining pipeline asizing accurate question answering based on finegrained userspecific information jarvis is capable of providing more accurate responses particularly when they depend on specific local details jarvis achieves stateoftheart results in both visual question answering and textonly tasks across multiple datasets indicating a practical path toward personalized ai assistants the code and dataset will be released while large language models have transformed how we interact with ai systems they suffer from a critical flaw they confidently generate false information that sounds entirely plausible this hallucination problem has become a major barrier to deploying these models in realworld applications where accuracy matters we developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects these errors in realtime by cross checking llm outputs against multiple knowledge sources our system combines structured databases live web searches and academic literature to verify factual claims as theyre generated when we detect inconsistencies we automatically correct them while preserving the natural flow of the response testing across various domains showed we could reduce hallucinations by without sacrificing response quality domain experts in healthcare finance and scientific research rated our corrected outputs satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified llm responses this work offers a practical solution for making llms more trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isnt an option big language models llms are changing the way businesses use software the way people live their lives and the way industries work companies like google highflyer anthropic openai and meta are making better llms so its crucial to look at how each model is different in terms of performance moral behaviour and usability as these differences are based on the different ideas that built them this study compares five top llms googles gemini highflyers deepseek anthropics claude openais gpt models and metas llama it performs this by analysing three important factors performance and accuracy ethics and bias mitigation and usability and integration it was found that claude has good moral reasoning gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has strong ethical frameworks deepseek is great at reasoning based on facts llama is good for open applications and chatgpt delivers balanced performance with a focus on usage it was concluded that these models are different in terms of how well they work how easy they are to use and how they treat people ethically making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in a way that makes the most of its strengths retrievalaugmented generation rag faces a core bottleneck with knowledgesparse and semantically ambiguous longtail queries where retrieval noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly postprocessing to tackle this we propose racot retrievalaware contrastiveofthought a novel framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the preretrieval stage by automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered contrastive question and extracting a deltaprompt to capture their key differences racot guides the model to proactively focus on the critical details that determine answer divergence this approach allows it to suppress semantic interference within a single retrieval pass overcoming the theoretical bottleneck of singlevector queries that struggle to ultaneously encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore on six authoritative benchmarks including popqa and triviaqaunfiltered racot outperforms strong baselines like rankrag and selfrag by percentage points it exhibits superior robustness with a performance drop of only in adversarial tests far surpassing the over degradation in other methods furthermore its low latency and token overhead place it on the accuracyefficiency pareto frontier while ablation studies validate the necessity of each component ultimately racot reframes the rag paradigm from posthoc context cleaning to a priori shaping of discriminative reasoning offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable ai systems for realtime resourceconstrained deployments we introduce the em atlas urban index aui a metric for measuring urban development computed using sentinel citepspotosentinel satellite imagery existing approaches such as the em normalized difference builtup index ndbi often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to factors like atmospheric noise seasonal variation and cloud cover these limitations hinder largescale monitoring of human development and urbanization to address these challenges we propose an approach that leverages em visionlanguage models vlms to provide a development score for regions specifically we collect a time series of sentinel images for each region then we further process the images within fixed time windows to get an image with minimal cloud cover which serves as the representative image for that time window to ensure consistent scoring we adopt two strategies i providing the vlm with a curated set of reference images representing different levels of urbanization and ii supplying the most recent past image to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloudrelated noise in the current image together these components enable aui to overcome the challenges of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable development scores our qualitative experiments on bangalore suggest that aui outperforms standard indices such as ndbi large language models llms often expend significant computational resources generating boilerplate responses such as refusals ple acknowledgements and casual greetings which adds unnecessary cost and latency to address this inefficiency we propose a ple yet highly effective method for detecting such responses after only a single generation step we demonstrate that the logprobability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response our experiments conducted across a diverse range of small large and reasoningspecialized models show that the firsttoken logprobability vectors form distinctly separable clusters for different response types using a lightweight knn classifier we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response including userspecified refusals the primary implication is a practical computationally trivial technique optimizing llm inference by enabling early termination or redirection to a smaller model thereby yielding significant savings in computational cost this work presents a direct path toward more efficient and sustainable llm deployment correctness alone is insufficient llmgenerated programs frequently satisfy unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets we present swiftsolve a complexityaware multiagent system for competitive programming that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and complexityguided repair we frame competitive programming as a software environment where specialized agents act as programmers each assuming roles such as planning coding profiling and complexity analysis a planner proposes an algorithmic sketch a deterministic static pruner filters highrisk plans a coder emits iso a profiler compiles and executes candidates on a fixed inputsize schedule to record wall time and peak memory and a complexity analyst fits loglog growth with an llm fallback to assign a complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the planner or coder agents communicate via typed versioned json a controller enforces iteration caps and diminishing returns stopping evaluated on problems bigo codeforces div in a posix sandbox mb swiftsolve attains pass on the first attempt and solved with marginal latency change mean to per attempt aggregate runlevel success is at mean failures are predominantly resourcebound indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors against claude opus swiftsolve improves runlevel success vs at imately runtime overhead vs beyond correctness passk we report efficiency metrics effk for runtime and memory incidence of tle or mle and complexity fit accuracy on bigo demonstrating that profiling and complexityguided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving accuracy the coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by the semantic gap between highlevel mission objectives and lowlevel planner inputs to address this we introduce a framework centered on a knowledge graph kg that functions as an intelligent translation layer the kgs twoplane architecture compiles declarative facts into peragent missionaware worldviews and physicsaware traversal rules decoupling mission semantics from a domainagnostic planner this allows complex coordinated paths to be modified ply by changing facts in the kg a case study involving autonomous underwater vehicles auvs in the gulf of mexico visually demonstrates the endtoend process and quantitatively proves that different declarative policies produce distinct highperforming outcomes this work establishes the kg not merely as a data repository but as a powerful stateful orchestrator for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to project a positive brand image however sometimes there is a mismatch between what they say and what they do oil gas companies for example are accused of greenwashing with imagery of climatefriendly initiatives understanding the framing and changes in framing at scale can help better understand the goals and nature of public relations campaigns to address this we introduce a benchmark dataset of expertannotated video ads obtained from facebook and youtube the dataset provides annotations for framing types for more than companies or advocacy groups across countries our dataset is especially designed for the evaluation of visionlanguage models vlms distinguishing it from past textonly framing datasets baseline experiments show some promising results while leaving room for improvement for future work gpt can detect environmental messages with score while our best model only achieves score on identifying framing around green innovation we also identify challenges that vlms must address such as implicit framing handling videos of various lengths or implicit cultural backgrounds our dataset contributes to research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy sector constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain ontology matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and creating a cohesive semantic layer while the ple pairwise state of the art is well established ple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic integration of related but disjoint ontologies complex multiontology matching cmom aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple target entities establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along the ontological hierarchy we present cmomgen the first endtoend cmom strategy that generates complete and semantically sound mappings without establishing any restrictions on the number of target ontologies or entities retrievalaugmented generation selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference mappings to serve as examples enhancing incontext learning the strategy was evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments cmomgen outperforms baselines in class selection demonstrating the impact of having a dedicated strategy our strategy also achieves a minimum of in fscore outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and placing second in the third furthermore a manual evaluation of nonreference mappings showed that of the mappings achieve the maximum score further substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings ai agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by automating literature reviews replicating experiments analyzing data and even proposing new directions of inquiry indeed there are now many such agents ranging from generalpurpose deep research systems to specialized sciencespecific agents such as ai scientist and aigs rigorous evaluation of these agents is critical for progress yet existing benchmarks fall short on several fronts they fail to provide holistic productinformed measures of realworld use cases such as science research lack reproducible agent tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and evaluation and lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify true advances in response we define principles and tooling for more rigorously benchmarking agents using these we present astabench a suite that provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific research comprising problems spanning the entire scientific discovery process and multiple scientific domains and including many problems inspired by actual user requests to deployed asta agents our suite comes with the first scientific research environment with productiongrade search tools that enable controlled reproducible evaluation better accounting for confounders alongside we provide a comprehensive suite of nine scienceoptimized classes of asta agents and numerous baselines our extensive evaluation of agents across agent classes reveals several interesting findings most importantly that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects ai remains far from solving the challenge of science research assistance large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problemsolving abilities yet realworld tasks often require external tools and longhorizon interactions existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows which limit autonomous and global task completion in this paper we introduce deepagent an endtoend deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking tool discovery and action execution within a single coherent reasoning process to address the challenges of longhorizon interactions particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the accumulation of interaction history we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic working and tool memories reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information to teach generalpurpose tool use efficiently and stably we develop an endtoend reinforcement learning strategy namely toolpo that leverages llmulated apis and applies toolcall advantage attribution to assign finegrained credit to the tool invocation tokens extensive experiments on eight benchmarks including general tooluse tasks toolbench apibank tmdb spotify toolhop and downstream applications alfworld webshop gaia hle demonstrate that deepagent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeledtool and openset tool retrieval scenarios this work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for realworld applications the code and demo are available at recent studies operationalize selfimprovement through coding agents that edit their own codebases they grow a tree of selfmodifications through expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark performance assuming that this implies more promising subsequent selfmodifications however we identify a mismatch between the agents selfimprovement potential metaproductivity and its coding benchmark performance namely the metaproductivityperformance mismatch inspired by huxleys concept of clade we propose a metric cmp that aggregates the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of its potential for selfimprovement we show that in our selfimproving coding agent development setting access to the true cmp is sufficient to ulate how the gdel machine would behave under certain assumptions we introduce the huxleygdel machine hgm which by estimating cmp and using it as guidance searches the tree of selfmodifications on swebench verified and polyglot hgm outperforms prior selfimproving coding agent development methods while using fewer allocated cpu hours last but not least hgm demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language models the agent optimized by hgm on swebench verified with gptmini and evaluated on swebench lite with gpt achieves humanlevel performance matching the best officially checked results of humanengineered coding agents our code is publicly available at safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in critical domains control barrier functions cbfs have been used to design safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to maintain their safety learning neural cbfs has been proposed as a datadriven alternative for their computationally expensive optimizationbased synthesis however it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be avoided is nonobvious or hard to specify formally eg tailgating in autonomous driving while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task and avoid the failure set is easier to generate we use icl to train a constraint function that classifies the states of the system under consideration to safe ie belong to a controlled forward invariant set that is disjoint from the unspecified failure set and unsafe ones ie belong to the complement of that set we then use that function to label a new set of ulated trajectories to train our neural cbf we empirically evaluate our approach in four different environments demonstrating that it outperforms existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural cbf trained with the same data but annotated with groundtruth safety labels longhorizon reasoning in llmbased agents often fails not from generative weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning cosight addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable process through two complementary mechanisms conflictaware metaverification camv and trustworthy reasoning with structured facts trsf camv reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted falsification allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains this bounds verification cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability trsf continuously organizes validates and synchronizes evidence across agents through a structured facts module by maintaining verified traceable and auditable knowledge it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent sourceverified information and supports transparent verification throughout the reasoning process together trsf and camv form a closed verification loop where trsf supplies structured facts and camv selectively falsifies or reinforces them yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning empirically cosight achieves stateoftheart accuracy on gaia and humanitys last exam and strong results on chinesepleqa ablation studies confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and conflictaware verification drives these improvements cosight thus offers a scalable paradigm for reliable longhorizon reasoning in llmbased agents code is available at large language models llms are increasingly deployed as agents in various contexts by providing tools at their disposal however llm agents can exhibit unpredictable behaviors including taking undesirable andor unsafe actions in order to measure the latent propensity of llm agents for taking illegal actions under an eu legislative context we introduce euagentbench a verifiable humancurated benchmark that evaluates an agents alignment with eu legal norms in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions our benchmark spans scenarios across several categories including data protection biasdiscrimination and scientific integrity with each user request allowing for both compliant and noncompliant execution of the requested actions comparing the models function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by citations of the relevant legislature we evaluate the legal compliance of frontier llms and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing the relevant legislative excerpts in the agents system prompt along with explicit instructions to comply we release a public preview set for the research community while holding out a private test set to prevent data contamination in evaluating upcoming models we encourage future work extending agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multiturn and multilingual interactions we release our code on href this url existing neural methods for multitask vehicle routing problems vrps typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints ultaneously however they often underutilize the compositional structure of vrp variants each derivable from a common set of basis vrp variants this critical oversight causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers each specialized for a basis vrp variant to overcome this limitation we propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the sharedcomponent nature across vrp variants by proactively reusing basis solvers while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers specifically we introduce a statedecomposable mdp sdmdp that reformulates vrps by expressing the state space as the cartesian product of basis state spaces associated with basis vrp variants more crucially this formulation inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis vrp variant furthermore a latent spacebased sdmdp extension is developed by incorporating both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the policy reuse in the latent space under mild assumptions this extension provably recovers the optimal unified policy of sdmdp through the mixture function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state embeddings generated by optimal basis policies for practical implementation we introduce the mixtureofspecializedexperts solver moses which realizes basis policies through specialized lowrank adaptation lora experts and implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism extensive experiments conducted across vrp variants showcase the superiority of moses over prior methods this study presents autooptk a unique image dataset of over handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to singleobjective multiobjective multilevel and stochastic optimization problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as nonlinearity nonconvexity nondifferentiability discontinuity and highdimensionality the labels consist of the latex representation for all the images and modeling language representation for a subset of images the dataset is created by experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in twophases to avoid errors further we develop autoopt framework a machine learning based automated approach for solving optimization problems where the user just needs to provide an image of the formulation and autoopt solves it efficiently without any further human intervention autoopt framework consists of three modules i imagetotext a deep learning model performs the mathematical expression recognition mer task to generate the latex code corresponding to the optimization formulation in image ii texttotext a smallscale finetuned llm generates the pyomo script optimization modeling language from latex code iii optimization a bilevel optimization based decomposition bobd method solves the optimization formulation described in the pyomo script we use autooptk dataset for training and testing of deep learning models employed in autoopt the deep learning model for mer task outperforms chatgpt gemini and nougat on bleu score metric bobd method which is a hybrid approach yields better results on complex test problems compared to common approaches like interiorpoint algorithm and genetic algorithm llms have demonstrated highly effective learning humanlike response generationand decisionmaking capabilities in highrisk sectors however these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in responses the literature has explored numerous approaches to address transparency challenges in llms including neurosymbolic ai nesy ai nesy ai approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are not wellsuited to the unique features of llms consequently there is a limited systematic understanding of how symbolic ai can be effectively integrated into llms this paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing established nesy ai methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic integration in llms along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with llms the roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories these include symbolic integration across various stages of llm coupling mechanisms architectural paradigms as well as algorithmic and applicationlevel perspectives the paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks cuttingedge advancements and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for future research by highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in the literature it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for symbolic integration into llms to enhance transparency testtime scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its computational efficiency and parameterindependent training to improve reasoning performance on large language models one such method is called budget forcing a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute budget for thinking and elicits the inherent selfcorrecting behavior of the model however this relies on supervised finetuning sft on longcontext reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to verbose responses for this reason we offer a framework integrating reinforcement learning rl to improve token efficiency and boost the performance of a model for mathematical reasoning we demonstrate this using only training samples and found that our sftrl model performed better on the gsmk dataset with varying compute budgets our main findings showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage by over compared to the sft model revealing how rl can recover the losses due to longcontext training and altogether improving performance in mathematical reasoning large language models llms often struggle with generating truly innovative ideas typically defaulting to highprobability familiar concepts within their training datas gravity wells while advanced searchbased methods like tree of thoughts tot attempt to mitigate this they are fundamentally limited by their reliance on unprincipled inconsistent selfevaluation heuristics to guide exploration to address this gap we introduce magellan a novel framework that reframes creative generation as a principled guided exploration of an llms latent conceptual space at its core magellan employs monte carlo tree search mcts governed by a hierarchical guidance system for longrange direction a semantic compass vector formulated via orthogonal projection steers the search towards relevant novelty for local stepbystep decisions a landscapeaware value function replaces flawed selfevaluation with an explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence extrinsic novelty and narrative progress extensive experiments demonstrate that magellan significantly outperforms strong baselines including react and tot in generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation our work shows that for creative discovery a principled guided search is more effective than unconstrained agency paving the way for llms to become more capable partners in innovation chest xray cxr plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis and a variety of taskspecific and foundation models have been developed for automatic cxr interpretation however these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic tasks and complex reasoning scenarios recently llmbased agent models have emerged as a promising paradigm for cxr analysis enhancing models capability through tool coordination multistep reasoning and team collaboration etc however existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack mechanisms for assessing tools reliability limiting their adaptability and credibility to this end we propose cxragent a directororchestrated multistage agent for cxr interpretation where a central director coordinates the following stages tool invocation the agent strategically orchestrates a set of cxranalysis tools with outputs normalized and verified by the evidencedriven validator edv which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis diagnostic planning guided by task requirements and intermediate findings the agent formulates a targeted diagnostic plan it then assembles an expert team accordingly defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive and collaborative reasoning collaborative decisionmaking the agent integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories synthesizing them into an evidencebacked diagnostic conclusion experiments on various cxr interpretation tasks show that cxragent delivers strong performance providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks of different complexity code and data are valuable at this href link recent advances in large language models llms have enabled the automatic generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents such as robots demonstrating the potential of llmbased embodied intelligence however these llmbased codeaspolicies approaches often suffer from limited environmental grounding particularly in dynamic or partially observable settings leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or incomplete code generation in this work we propose a neurosymbolic embodied task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and interactive validation processes during code generation in the validation phase the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving taskrelevant states this integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex environments we evaluate our framework on rlbench and in realworld settings across dynamic partially observable scenarios experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by over codeaspolicies baselines and attains over executability of taskrelevant actions thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in dynamic environments background trustworthy ai serves as a foundational pillar for two major ai ethics conferences aies and facct however current research often adopts technocentric approaches focusing primarily on technical attributes such as reliability robustness and fairness while overlooking the sociotechnical dimensions critical to understanding ai trustworthiness in realworld contexts objectives this scoping review aims to examine how the aies and facct communities conceptualize measure and validate ai trustworthiness identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding of trustworthy ai systems methods we conduct a scoping review of aies and facct conference proceedings to date systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined operationalized and applied across different research domains our analysis focuses on conceptualization approaches measurement methods verification and validation techniques application areas and underlying values results while significant progress has been made in defining technical attributes such as transparency accountability and robustness our findings reveal critical gaps current research often predominantly asizes technical precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations the sociotechnical nature of ai systems remains less explored and trustworthiness emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it conclusions an interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with social cultural and institutional considerations is essential for advancing trustworthy ai we propose actionable measures for the ai ethics community to adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between ai systems and society ultimately promoting responsible technological development that benefits all stakeholders large reasoning models lrms demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks including harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks existing mitigation strategies rely on injecting heuristic safety signals during training which often suppress reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safetyreasoning tradeoff to systematically investigate this issue we analyze the reasoning trajectories of diverse lrms and uncover a phenomenon we term selfjailbreak where models override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts this finding reveals that lrms inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe queries but this ability is compromised resulting in harmful outputs building on these insights we propose the chainofguardrail cog a training framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps steering the model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks demonstrate that cog substantially improves the safety of current lrms while preserving comparable reasoning ability significantly outperforming prior methods that suffer from severe safetyreasoning tradeoffs the upper confidence bounds for trees uct algorithm is not agnostic to the reward scale of the game it is applied to for zerosum games with the sparse rewards of at the end of the game this is not a problem but many games often feature dense rewards with handpicked reward scales causing a nodes qvalue to span different magnitudes across different games in this paper we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the uct exploration constant lambda called lambdastrategies that are agnostic to the games reward scale these lambdastrategies include those proposed in the literature as well as five new strategies given our experimental results we recommend using one of our newly suggested lambdastrategies which is to choose lambda as cdot sigma where sigma is the empirical standard deviation of all stateaction pairs qvalues of the search tree this method outperforms existing lambdastrategies across a wide range of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances obtained by optimizing all available parameters the operational capabilities and application domains of aienabled autonomous systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics and machine learning ml demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations throughout the system lifecycle including detecting outofdistribution ood data thus ood detection is receiving increased attention from the research development and safety engineering communities this comprehensive review analyses ood detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for autonomous systems in particular in safetycritical domains we begin by defining the relevant concepts investigating what causes ood and exploring the factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and ood detection challenging our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used throughout the ml development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments we discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of when integrating ood detection into system lifecycles we conclude by outlining the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications we propose outboundeval a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models llms in expertlevel intelligent outbound calling scenarios unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations insufficient dataset diversity and category coverage unrealistic user ulation and inaccurate evaluation metrics outboundeval addresses these issues through a structured framework first we design a benchmark spanning six major business domains and representative subscenarios each with scenariospecific process decomposition weighted scoring and domainadaptive metrics second we develop a largemodeldriven user ulator that generates diverse personarich virtual users with realistic behaviors emotional variability and communication styles providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment third we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations integrating automated and humanintheloop assessment to measure task execution accuracy professional knowledge application adaptability and user experience quality experiments on stateoftheart llms reveal distinct tradeoffs between expertlevel task completion and interaction fluency offering practical insights for building reliable humanlike outbound ai systems outboundeval establishes a practical extensible and domainoriented standard for benchmarking llms in professional applications causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to its prevalent application existing methods rely on human experience statistical methods or graphical criteria methods which are errorprone stuck at the idealized assumption and rely on a huge amount of data and there is also a serious data gap in accessing multivariate time seriesmts in many areas adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship existing methods are easy to be overfitting on them to fill the gap we mentioned above in this paper we propose shylock a novel method that can work well in both fewshot and normal mts to find the causal relationship shylock can reduce the number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a sharing kernel but still learn a better representation of variables with time delay by combing the global constraint and the local constraint shylock achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy to evaluate the performance of shylock we also design a data generation method to generate mts with time delay we evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and generated datasets extensive experiments show that shylock outperforms two existing stateofart methods on both fewshot and normal mts we also developed tcausal a library for easy use and deployed it on the earthdataminer platform pretrained visionlanguage models vlms such as clip have demonstrated remarkable zeroshot generalization enabling deployment in a wide range of realworld tasks without additional taskspecific training however in real deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes these models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks in such contexts static zeroshot capabilities are insufficient and there is a growing need for continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding catastrophic forgetting we introduce nusacl null space adaptation for continual learning a lightweight memoryfree continual learning framework designed to address this challenge nusacl employs lowrank adaptation and constrains taskspecific weight updates to lie within an imate null space of the models current parameters this strategy minimizes interference with previously acquired knowledge effectively preserving the zeroshot capabilities of the original model unlike methods relying on replay buffers or costly distillation nusacl imposes minimal computational and memory overhead making it practical for deployment in resourceconstrained realworld continual learning environments experiments show that our framework not only effectively preserves zeroshot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks these results position nusacl as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving zeroshot vlms in realworld applications we introduce string seed of thought ssot a novel prompting method for llms that improves probabilistic instruction following pif we define pif as a task requiring an llm to select its answer from a predefined set of options each associated with a specific probability such that the empirical distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when prompted multiple times while llms excel at tasks with single deterministic answers they often fail at pif exhibiting biases problematic for applications requiring nondeterministic behaviors such as humanbehavior ulation content diversification and multiplayer games it also harms the diversity of generated responses a crucial factor in testtime scaling by causing the outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers to address this we propose ssot a ple prompting method that instructs an llm to first output a random string to generate sufficient entropy ssot also instructs the llm to extract randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer thereby preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints we demonstrate that ssot significantly improves the pif performance of llms approaching the ideal performance of a pseudorandom number generator furthermore our experiments on noveltybench show ssots benefits extend beyond closedset tasks to openended tasks by enhancing response diversity designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models llms on domainspecific tasks is both necessary and challenging in realworld applications determining how to integrate domain knowledge enhance reasoning efficiency and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks in this research we propose evolutionary graph optimization for prompting egoprompt an automated framework to designing better prompts efficient reasoning processes and providing enhanced causalinformed process egoprompt begins with a general prompt and faulttolerant initial semantic causal graph scg descriptions constructed by human experts which is then automatically refined and optimized to guide llm reasoning recognizing that expertdefined scgs may be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across llms egoprompt integrates a novel causalguided textual gradient process in two steps first generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the scg for each instance and second adapting the llm to effectively utilize the guidance alongside the original input the iterative optimization algorithm further refines both the scg and the reasoning mechanism using textual gradients with groundtruth we tested the framework on realworld public health transportation and human behavior tasks egoprompt achieves higher than cuttingedge methods and allows small models to reach the performence of larger models at under of the original cost it also outputs a refined domainspecific scg that improves interpretability retrievalaugmented generation rag empowers large language models llms to dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference improving their factual accuracy and adaptability however adversaries can inject poisoned external knowledge to override the models internal memory while existing attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of rag they largely ignore the models internal representation dynamics and neuronlevel sensitivities the underlying mechanism of rag poisoning has not been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric knowledge in rag is not considered in this work we propose neurogenpoisoning a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in rag guided by llm internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization our method first identifies a set of poisonresponsive neurons whose activation strongly correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge we then employ a genetic algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons crucially our framework enables massivescale generation of effective poisoned rag knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals at the same time poisonresponsive neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge conflict experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate consistently achieving high population overwrite success rate posr of over while preserving fluency empirical evidence shows that our method effectively resolves knowledge conflict panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress in which timely appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability however suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to ethical and logistical issues to address this we introduce pace which is a dataset that includes highdistress episodes constructed from firstperson narratives and structured around the principles of psychological first aid pfa using this data we train pacer a counseling model designed to provide both empathetic and directive support which is optimized through supervised learning and ulated preference alignment to assess its effectiveness we propose paniceval a multidimensional framework covering general counseling quality and crisisspecific strategies experimental results show that pacer outperforms strong baselines in both counselorside metrics and client affect improvement human evaluations further confirm its practical value with pacer consistently preferred over general cbtbased and gptpowered models in panic scenarios code is available at this paper presents a first empirical study of agentic ai as autonomous decisionmakers in decentralized governance using more than proposals from major protocols we build an agentic ai voter that interprets proposal contexts retrieves historical deliberation data and independently determines its voting position the agent operates within a realistic financial ulation environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data implemented through a modular composable program mcp workflow that defines data flow and tool usage via agentics framework we evaluate how closely the agents decisions align with the human and tokenweighted outcomes uncovering strong alignments measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics our findings demonstrate that agentic ai can augment collective decisionmaking by producing interpretable auditable and empirically grounded signals in realistic dao governance settings the study contributes to the design of explainable and economically rigorous ai agents for decentralized financial systems a key task in artificial intelligence is learning effective policies for controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures offpolicy learning methods like qlearning allow learners to make optimal decisions based on past experiences this paper studies offpolicy learning from biased data in complex and highdimensional domains where unobserved confounding cannot be ruled out a priori building on the wellcelebrated deep qnetwork dqn we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm robust to confounding biases in observed data specifically our algorithm attempts to find a safe policy for the worstcase environment compatible with the observations we apply our method to twelve confounded atari games and find that it consistently dominates the standard dqn in all games where the observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved confounders exist recently large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare however the deployment of large visionlanguage models lvlms for clinical services is currently hindered by three critical challenges a tendency to hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence the inefficiency of fixeddepth reasoning and the difficulty of multiinstitutional collaboration to address these challenges in this paper we develop medalign a novel framework to ensure visually accurate lvlm responses for medical visual question answering medvqa specifically we first propose a multimodal direct preference optimization mdpo objective to explicitly align preference learning with visual context we then design a retrievalaware mixtureofexperts ramoe architecture that utilizes image and text ilarity to route queries to a specialized and contextaugmented lvlm ie an expert thereby mitigating hallucinations in lvlms to achieve adaptive reasoning and facilitate multiinstitutional collaboration we propose a federated governance mechanism where the selected expert finetuned on clinical datasets based on mdpo locally performs iterative chainofthought cot reasoning via the local metacognitive uncertainty estimator extensive experiments on three representative medvqa datasets demonstrate that medalign achieves stateoftheart performance outperforming strong retrievalaugmented baselines by up to in fscore and ultaneously reducing the average reasoning length by compared with fixeddepth cot approaches the complexity of structured query language sql and the specialized nature of geospatial functions in tools like postgis present significant barriers to nonexperts seeking to analyze spatial data while large language models llms offer promise for translating natural language into sql texttosql singleagent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic complexities of spatial queries to address this we propose a multiagent framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into spatial sql queries the framework integrates several innovative components including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment embeddings for context retrieval and a collaborative multiagent pipeline as its core this pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity extraction metadata retrieval query logic formulation sql generation and a review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the generated sql to ensure correctness selfverification we evaluate our system using both the nonspatial kaggledbqa benchmark and a new comprehensive spatialqueryqa benchmark that includes diverse geometry types predicates and three levels of query complexity on kaggledbqa the system achieved an overall accuracy of out of questions after the review agents review and corrections for spatial queries the system achieved an overall accuracy of out of questions compared with without the review agent beyond accuracy results also show that in some instances the system generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than those in the benchmarks this work makes spatial analysis more accessible and provides a robust generalizable foundation for spatial texttosql systems advancing the development of autonomous gis when should we defer to ai outputs over human expert judgment drawing on recent work in social epistemology i motivate the idea that some ai systems qualify as artificial epistemic authorities aeas due to their demonstrated reliability and epistemic superiority i then introduce ai preemptionism the view that aea outputs should replace rather than supplement a users independent epistemic reasons i show that classic objections to preemptionism such as uncritical deference epistemic entrenchment and unhinging epistemic bases apply in amplified form to aeas given their opacity selfreinforcing authority and lack of epistemic failure markers against this i develop a more promising alternative a total evidence view of ai deference according to this view aea outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than outright replacements for a users independent epistemic considerations this approach has three key advantages i it mitigates expertise atrophy by keeping human users engaged ii it provides an epistemic case for meaningful human oversight and control and iii it explains the justified mistrust of ai when reliability conditions are unmet while demanding in practice this account offers a principled way to determine when ai deference is justified particularly in highstakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability harmonizing medication data across electronic health record ehr systems is a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder moud in heterogeneous ehr systems key prescription attributes are scattered across differently formatted fields and freetext notes we present a practical framework that customizes open source large language models llms including llama qwen gemma and medgemma to extract a unified set of moud prescription attributes prescription date drug name duration total quantity daily quantity and refills from heterogeneous site specific data and compute a standardized metric of medication coverage moud days per patient our pipeline processes records directly in a fixed json schema followed by lightweight normalization and crossfield consistency checks we evaluate the system on prescription level ehr data from five clinics in a national oud study records from patients using a previously annotated benchmark of records patients as the ground truth performance is reported as coverage share of records with a valid matchable output and recordlevel exactmatch accuracy larger models perform best overall qwenb achieves textbf coverage with textbf exactmatch accuracy across clinics and medgemmab attains textbftextbf a brief error review highlights three common issues and fixes imputing missing dosage fields using withindrug norms handling monthlyweekly injectables eg vivitrol by setting duration from the documented schedule and adding unit checks to prevent mass units eg from being misread as daily counts by removing brittle sitespecific etl and supporting local privacypreserving deployment this approach enables consistent crosssite analyses of moud exposure adherence and retention in realworld settings fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets their objective is to better represent imprecise data however operations on fuzzy numbers are not as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers commonly the zadehs extension rule is applied to elaborate a result this can produce two problems high computational complexity and for some fuzzy sets and some operations the results is not a fuzzy set with the same features eg multiplication of two triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set one more problem is the fuzzy spread fuzziness of the result increases with the number of operations these facts can severely limit the application field of fuzzy numbers in this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a different kind of fuzzy numbers extensional fuzzy numbers the paper defines operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators for them the proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational examples the implementation is available from a public github repository in openended domains like art autonomous agents must generate ideas that are both original and internally coherent yet current large language models llms either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when pushed toward novelty we address this by introducing the cultural alien sampler cas a conceptselection method that explicitly separates compositional fit from cultural typicality cas uses two gpt models finetuned on wikiart concepts a concept coherence model that scores whether concepts plausibly cooccur within artworks and a cultural context model that estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists bodies of work cas targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in typicality yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating from learned conventions and embedded cultural context in a human evaluation our approach outperforms random selection and gpto baselines and achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived originality and harmony additionally a quantitative study shows that our method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space than its gpto counterpart demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents this study introduces a humanintheloop pipeline that converts unscaled handdrawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent bim models the workflow leverages multimodal large language models mllms within a multiagent framework combining perceptual extraction human feedback schema validation and automated bim scripting initially sketches are iteratively refined into a structured json layout of walls doors and windows later these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate bim models experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence openings doors windows are captured with high reliability in the initial pass while wall detection begins around and achieves nearperfect alignment after a few feedback iterations across all categories precision recall and scores remain above and geometric errors rmse mae progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections this study demonstrates how mllmdriven multiagent reasoning can make bim creation accessible to both experts and nonexperts using only freehand sketches computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation monitoring yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in blackbox neuralnetworkbased models we seek to address this challenge by applying posthoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document limitations that are important to field deployment using aerial imagery from glacier bay national park we train a faster rcnn to detect pinnipeds harbor seals and generate explanations via gradientbased class activation mapping hirescam layercam local interpretable modelagnostic explanations lime and perturbationbased explanations we assess explanations along three axes relevant to field use i localization fidelity whether highattribution regions coincide with the animal rather than background context ii faithfulness whether deletioninsertion tests produce changes in detector confidence and iii diagnostic utility whether explanations reveal systematic failure modes explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours rather than surrounding icerock and removal of the seals reduces detection confidence providing modelevidence for true positives the analysis also uncovers recurrent error sources including confusion between seals and black ice and rocks we translate these findings into actionable next steps for model development including more targeted data curation and augmentation by pairing object detection with posthoc explainability we can move beyond blackbox predictions toward auditable decisionsupporting tools for conservation monitoring tracking human fullbody motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement units imus overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the environment inherent in visionbased approaches however purely imubased tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning between individuals as inertial cues are inherently selfreferential and provide no direct spatial reference for others in this paper we present a novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable sensors both on each individual and across multiple individuals our method group inertial poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of sensors from ultrawideband ranging uwb and fuses them with inertial observations as input into structured statespace models to integrate temporal motion patterns for precise pose estimation our novel twostep optimization further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking peoples global trajectories through the world we also introduce gipdb the first imuuwb dataset for twoperson tracking which comprises minutes of motion recordings from participants in our evaluation group inertial poser outperforms previous stateoftheart methods in accuracy and robustness across synthetic and realworld data showing the promise of imuuwbbased multihuman motion capture in the wild code models dataset this paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework gompertzcnn which integrates the gompertz growth model into the training process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of student models leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer to overcome this we propose a stageaware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight of distillation loss based on the gompertz curve reflecting the students learning progression slow initial growth rapid midphase improvement and latestage saturation our framework incorporates wasserstein distance to measure featurelevel discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward propagation behaviors between teacher and student models these components are unified under a multiloss objective where the gompertz curve modulates the influence of distillation losses over time extensive experiments on cifar and cifar using various teacherstudent architectures eg resnet and mobilenetv demonstrate that gompertzcnn consistently outperforms traditional distillation methods achieving up to and accuracy gains on cifar and cifar respectively deploying reinforcement learning rl in safetycritical settings is constrained by brittleness under distribution shift we study outofdistribution ood detection for rl time series and introduce deedee a twostatistic detector that revisits representationheavy pipelines with a minimal alternative deedee uses only an episodewise mean and an rbf kernel ilarity to a training summary capturing complementary global and local deviations despite its plicity deedee matches or surpasses contemporary detectors across standard rl ood suites delivering a fold reduction in compute flops walltime and an average absolute accuracy gain over strong baselines conceptually our results indicate that diverse anomaly types often imprint on rl trajectories through a small set of loworder statistics suggesting a compact foundation for ood detection in complex environments knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from complex teacher models to smaller resourceefficient student models that can be deployed easily particularly in taskaware scenarios however existing methods of taskaware distillation typically require substantial quantities of data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical scenarios in this paper we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy called counterfactualexplanationinfused distillation cod for fewshot taskaware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing counterfactual explanations counterfactual explanations cfes refer to inputs that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum perturbation our strategy cod leverages these cfes to precisely map the teachers decision boundary with significantly fewer samples we provide theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of cfes in distillation from both statistical and geometric perspectives we mathematically show that cfes can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near the teachers decision boundary we also derive geometric insights on how cfes effectively act as knowledge probes helping the students mimic the teachers decision boundaries more effectively than standard data we perform experiments across various datasets and llms to show that cod outperforms standard distillation approaches in fewshot regimes as low as samples notably cod only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines paired with their corresponding cfes and still improves performance understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology philosophy and artificial intelligence existing accounts from classical logic to probabilistic models illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling but do not offer a unified quantitative description of general human reasoning dynamics to solve this we introduce information flow tracking iftrack that uses large language models llms as probabilistic encoder to quantify information entropy and gain at each reasoning step through finegrained analyses across diverse tasks our method is the first successfully models the universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space we show that iftrack captures essential reasoning features identifies systematic error patterns and characterizes individual differences applied to discussion of advanced psychological theory we first reconcile single versus dualprocess theories in iftrack and discover the alignment of artificial and human cognition and how llms reshaping human reasoning process this approach establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement offering mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning the increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation techniques however current methods often succeed in replicating ple summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higherorder correlation structure of the data that define the complex multivariable interactions inherent in realworld systems this limitation can lead to synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for sophisticated modeling tasks in this white paper we introduce generative correlation manifolds gcm a computationally efficient method for generating synthetic data the technique uses cholesky decomposition of a target correlation matrix to produce datasets that by mathematical proof preserve the entire correlation structure from ple pairwise relationships to higherorder interactions of the source dataset we argue that this method provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential applications in privacypreserving data sharing robust model training and ulation group relative policy optimization grpo has shown strong potential for flowmatchingbased texttoimage ti generation but it faces two key limitations inaccurate advantage attribution and the neglect of temporal dynamics of generation in this work we argue that shifting the optimization paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these issues building on this idea we propose chunkgrpo the first chunklevel grpobased approach for ti generation the insight is to group consecutive steps into coherent chunks that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of flow matching and to optimize policies at the chunk level in addition we introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance performance extensive experiments show that chunkgrpo achieves superior results in both preference alignment and image quality highlighting the promise of chunklevel optimization for grpobased methods large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities excelling at benchmarks once considered very difficult as their capabilities grow there is a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surfacelevel linguistic competence namely language competence involves not only syntax and semantics but also pragmatics ie understanding situational meaning as shaped by context as well as linguistic and cultural norms to contribute to this line of research we introduce sloprageval and slopragmega the first pragmatics understanding benchmarks for slovene that contain altogether multiplechoice questions we discuss the difficulties of translation describe the campaign to establish a human baseline and report pilot evaluations with llms our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker meaning in nonliteral utterances especially those that are culturespecific we also observe a significant gap between proprietary and opensource models finally we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care preferably constructed from native data and validated with human responses this paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation visionlanguageaction vla models using a large corpus of unscripted reallife video recordings of human hand activities treating human hand as dexterous robot endeffector we show that inthewild egocentric human videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully aligned with existing robotic vla training data in terms of task granularity and labels this is achieved by the development of a fullyautomated holistic human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos this approach can generate atomiclevel hand activity segments and their language descriptions each accompanied with framewise hand motion and camera motion we process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a handvla training dataset containing episodes and frames this training data covers a wide range of objects and concepts dexterous manipulation tasks and environment variations in real life vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data we design a dexterous hand vla model architecture and pretrain the model on this dataset the model exhibits strong zeroshot capabilities on completely unseen realworld observations additionally finetuning it on a small amount of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments we also demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the models task performance with respect to pretraining data scale we believe this work lays a solid foundation for scalable vla pretraining advancing robots toward truly generalizable embodied intelligence with the current progress of artificial intelligence ai technology and its increasingly broader applications trust is seen as a required criterion for ai usage acceptance and deployment a robust measurement instrument is essential to correctly evaluate trust from a humancentered perspective this paper describes the development and validation process of a trust measure instrument which follows psychometric principles and consists of a items trust scale the instrument was built explicitly for research in humanai interaction to measure trust attitudes towards ai systems from layperson nonexpert perspective the usecase we used to develop the scale was in the context of ai medical support systems specifically cancerhealth prediction the scale development measurement item development and validation measurement item evaluation involved six research stages item development item evaluation survey administration test of dimensionality test of reliability and test of validity the results of the sixstages evaluation show that the proposed trust measurement instrument is empirically reliable and valid for systematically measuring and comparing nonexperts trust in ai medical support systems vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of multimodal large language models mllms in vision language tasks such as visual question answering and reasoning however existing vision encoders focus on global image representations but overlook finegrained regional analysis they are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pretraining paradigm in this paper we propose granvit a novel vision transformer that integrates finegrained feature extraction with semantic alignment to large language models llms via region level autoregressive training we first construct granm a dataset comprising million natural and ocr images paired with over million highquality regionlevel annotations to enable large scale fine grained pretraining consequently we develop a pretrainingadaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to train finegrained granvit on granm we sufficiently exploit the finegrained annotations from granm to resort to boundingboxtocaption regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in the pretraining and captiontoboundingbox regression to improve vision feature utilization and localization for llm in the adaptation we further incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning capability extensive experiments show that granvit surpasses existing vision encoders and attains strong transferability to varying llms remarkably it achieves stateoftheart results on finegrained recognition multimodal vqa and ocr understanding as artificial intelligence continues to advance and becomes more integrated into sensitive areas like healthcare education and everyday life its crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust this paper shows how resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots which through it ensure trust in the robot itselfan essential element especially when operating in contexts with elderly people who often have low trust in these systems resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful conditions even when degraded or weakened while maintaining essential operational capabilities interactive world models that ulate object dynamics are crucial for robotics vr and ar however it remains a significant challenge to learn physicsconsistent dynamics models from limited realworld video data especially for deformable objects with spatiallyvarying physical properties to overcome the challenge of data scarcity we propose physworld a novel framework that utilizes a ulator to synthesize physically plausible and diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models specifically we first construct a physicsconsistent digital twin within mpm ulator via constitutive model selection and globaltolocal optimization of physical properties subsequently we apply partaware perturbations to the physical properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations finally using these demonstrations we train a lightweight gnnbased world model that is embedded with physical properties the real video can be used to further refine the physical properties physworld achieves accurate and fast future predictions for various deformable objects and also generalizes well to novel interactions experiments show that physworld has competitive performance while enabling inference speeds times faster than the recent stateoftheart method ie phystwin object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited annotated data in specialized domains we introduce dinoyolo a hybrid architecture combining yolov with dinov selfsupervised vision transformers for dataefficient detection dinov features are strategically integrated at two locations input preprocessing and midbackbone enhancement experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements tunnel segment crack detection images achieves improvement construction ppe images gains and kitti images shows improvement while maintaining realtime inference fps systematic ablation across five yolo scales and nine dinov variants reveals that mediumscale architectures achieve optimal performance with dualpp integration map while smallscale requires triple integration the inference overhead ms versus ms baseline remains acceptable for field deployment on nvidia rtx dinoyolo establishes stateoftheart performance for civil engineering datasets images while preserving computational efficiency providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and infrastructure inspection in dataconstrained environments as llm agents advance they are increasingly mediating economic decisions ranging from product discovery to transactions on behalf of users such applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent accountability and value for users addressing these questions requires understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions however previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings such as singletask marketplaces eg negotiation or structured twoagent interactions realworld markets are fundamentally different they require agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in openended dialogues to bridge this gap we investigate twosided agentic marketplaces where assistant agents represent consumers and service agents represent competing businesses to study these interactions safely we develop magenticmarketplace a ulated environment where assistants and services can operate this environment enables us to study key market dynamics the utility agents achieve behavioral biases vulnerability to manipulation and how search mechanisms shape market outcomes our experiments show that frontier models can approach optimal welfare but only under ideal search conditions performance degrades sharply with scale and all models exhibit severe firstproposal bias creating advantages for response speed over quality these findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market

research is currently centered on the targetdependent stance detection task which is based on a persons stance in favor of or against a specific target furthermore most benchmark datasets are based on english making it difficult to develop models in lowresource languages such as korean especially for an emerging field such as stance detection this study proposes the largescale targetindependent stance lastist dataset to fill this research gap collected from the press releases of both parties on korean political parties the lastist dataset uses labeled korean sentences we provide a detailed description of how we collected and constructed the dataset and trained stateoftheart deep learning and stance detection models our lastist dataset is designed for various tasks in stance detection including targetindependent stance detection and diachronic evolution stance detection we deploy our dataset on large language models llms are increasingly deployed with taskspecific adapters catering

out to be disproportionately significant during inference time upto times that of the base model in this paper we propose a new zerolatency fused lowrank adapter zflora that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of the base model experimental results on llms of size and show that zflora compares favorably against the popular supervised finetuning benchmarks including lowrank adapters lora as well as full finetuning fft experiments are conducted on different tasks across three different categories namely commonsense reasoning math reasoning and summarydialogue latency measurements made on npu samsung galaxy as well as gpu nvidia platforms show that the proposed zflora adapters introduce zero to negligible latency overhead wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series yet the principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear we hypothesize that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning with different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct scales to test this resolution hypothesis we introduce himae hierarchical masked autoencoder a self supervised framework that combines masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder himae produces multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal scales carry predictive signal transforming resolution from a hyperparameter into a probe for interpretability across classification regression and generative benchmarks himae consistently outperforms state of the art foundation models that collapse scale while being orders of magnitude smaller himae is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on watch achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class cpus for true edge inference together these contributions position himae as both an efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale sensitive structure in wearable health one of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit discovery determining which parts of a model perform a given task we build on the mechanistic interpretability benchmark mib and propose three key improvements to circuit discovery first we use bootstrapping to identify edges with consistent attribution scores second we introduce a ple ratiobased selection strategy to prioritize strong positivescoring edges balancing performance and faithfulness third we replace the standard greedy selection with an integer linear programming formulation our methods yield more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple mib tasks and models our code is available at the deployment of ai on edge computing devices faces significant challenges related to energy consumption and functionality these devices could greatly benefit from braininspired learning mechanisms allowing for realtime adaptation while using lowpower inmemory computing with nanoscale resistive memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of ai workloads on these edge devices in this study we introduce voltagedependent synaptic plasticity vdsp as an

device variability such as switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness chainofthought cot supervision can substantially improve transformer performance yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit from cot remain poorly understood we investigate these learning dynamics through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to study their generalization models were trained under two settings i producing only final answers and ii emitting explicit cot traces before answering our results show that while cot generally improves task performance its benefits depend on task complexity to quantify these effects we model the accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a threeparameter logistic curve revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity data distribution and the presence of cot supervision we also uncover a transient trace unfaithfulness phase early in training models often produce correct answers while skipping or contradicting cot steps before later aligning their reasoning traces with answers empirically we demonstrate that cot accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher algorithmic complexity such as finding list intersections introduce a kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over training and show cot alters internal transformer computation mechanistically ridepooling also known as ridesharing shared ridehailing or microtransit is a service wherein passengers share rides this service can reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and environmental impacts a key limitation however is its myopic decisionmaking which overlooks longterm effects of dispatch decisions to address this we propose a ulationinformed reinforcement learning rl approach while rl has been widely studied in the context of ridehailing systems its application in ridepooling systems has been less explored in this study we extend the learning and planning framework of xu et al from ridehailing to ridepooling by embedding a ridepooling ulation within the learning mechanism to enable nonmyopic decisionmaking in addition we propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles by employing nstep temporal difference learning on ulated experiences we derive spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the nonmyopic policy using nyc taxi request data results demonstrate that the nonmyopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to versus a myopic policy while reducing both invehicle and wait times for passengers furthermore the proposed nonmyopic policy can decrease fleet size by over compared to a myopic policy while maintaining the same level of performance thereby offering significant cost savings for operators incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time by up to invehicle time by and raises service rate by compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger the dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large visionlanguage models lvlms while recent knowledge editing techniques hint at promising directions they often focus on editing a single modality vision or language in isolation this prevalent practice neglects the inherent multimodality of lvlms and the continuous nature of knowledge updates potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement to address these limitations we propose memeic a novel method for continual and compositional knowledge editing ccke in lvlms memeic enables compositional editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially our approach employs a hybrid externalinternal editor featuring a dual external memory for crossmodal evidence retrieval and dual lora adapters that facilitate disentangled parameter updates for each modality a key component is a braininspired knowledge connector activated selectively for compositional reasoning that integrates information across different modalities experiments demonstrate that memeic significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits setting a new benchmark for ccke in lvlms reinforcement learning rl with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of mllmr approaches that bring rl to vision language models most representative paradigms begin with a cold start typically employing supervised finetuning sft to initialize the policy before rl however sftbased cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format which may induce instructionstyle overfitting weakens outofdistribution generalization and ultimately affects downstream rl we revisit the cold start along two views its training method and data construction and introduce the generalization factor gf coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods our empirical study finds that preferencebased training methods eg dpo generalizes better than sftbased methods in cold start motivated by this we propose specsa selfdistilled preferencebased cold start framework that decouples multimodal learning generates introspective preference data pairs via selfdistillation avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation performs preferencebased training to learn focusing on shallow transferable surfaceform criteria format structure style rather than memorizing content and hands off to rl with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results experimental results across

the interaction between different ai agents deployed in markets lead to collusion more generally understanding how emergent behavior be it a cartel or market dominance from more advanced bots affects the market overall is an important research question we propose a hierarchical multiagent reinforcement learning framework to study algorithmic collusion in market making the framework includes a selfinterested market maker agenta which is trained in an uncertain environment shaped by an adversary and three bottomlayer competitors the selfinterested agentb whose objective is to maximize its own pnl the competitive agentb whose objective is to minimize the pnl of its opponent and the hybrid agentbstar which can modulate between the behavior of the other two to analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and affect market outcomes we propose interactionlevel metrics that quantify behavioral asymmetry and systemlevel dynamics while providing signals potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns experimental results show that agentb secures dominant performance in a zerosum setting against aggressively capturing order flow while tightening average spreads thus improving market execution efficiency in contrast agentbstar exhibits a selfinterested inclination when coexisting with other profitseeking agents securing dominant market share through adaptive quoting yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of agentsa and compared to these findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports more sustainable strategic coexistence

support vector machine svm deep neural network dnn recurrent neural network rnn and convolutional neural network cnn additionally workflows such as pickandplace and packing could be identified with ilarly high confidence our findings demonstrate that acoustic signals can support realtime lowcost passive verification in sensitive robotic environments without requiring hardware modifications reconstructing images seen by people from their fmri brain recordings provides a noninvasive window into the human brain despite recent progress enabled by diffusion models current methods often lack faithfulness to the actual seen images we present brainit a braininspired approach that addresses this challenge through a brain interaction transformer bit allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionallyilar brainvoxels these functionalclusters are shared by all subjects serving as building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains all model components are shared by all clusters subjects allowing efficient training with a limited amount of data to guide the image reconstruction bit predicts two complementary localized patchlevel image features ihighlevel semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic content of the image and iilowlevel structural features which help to initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image bits design enables direct flow of information from brainvoxel clusters to localized image features through these principles our method achieves image

highly sensitive yet miniature detector of ionizing radiation the detectors exceptionally low weight opens up new possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile mavs we propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the compton camera measurements to estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely sparse measurements the data readout and processing are performed directly onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of the vehicles the mavs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to maximize the information gained by the compton cameras rapidly locate the radiation source and even track a moving radiation source the ability of llm agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety risks making a comprehensive redteaming system crucial for discovering vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment we present siraj a generic redteaming framework for arbitrary blackbox llm agents we employ a dynamic twostep process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes tooluse trajectories and risk sources then it iteratively constructs and refines modelbased adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts to optimize the redteaming cost we present a model distillation approach that leverages structured forms of a teacher models reasoning to train smaller models that are equally effective across diverse evaluation agent settings our seed test case generation approach yields boost to the coverage of

iterative framework structured reasoning and the generalization of our redteamer models knowledge distillation kd is an effective method for model compression and transferring knowledge between models however its effect on models robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on outofdistribution data remains underexplored this study investigates the effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of debiasing capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language inference nli and image classification tasks through extensive experiments we illustrate several key findings i overall the debiasing capability of a model is undermined postkd ii training a debiased model does not benefit from injecting teacher knowledge iii although the overall robustness of a model may remain stable postdistillation significant variations can occur across different types of biases and iv we pinpoint the internal attention pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior postkd given the above findings we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of debiasing methods developing high quality data for augmentation implementing iterative knowledge distillation and initializing student models with weights obtained from teacher models to the best of our knowledge this is the first study on the effect of kd on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale our findings provide understandings on how kd works and how to design better debiasing methods we propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion models that leverages visionlanguage models vlms to adaptively generate negative prompts during the denoising process unlike traditional negative prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts our method generates intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a vlm to produce contextually appropriate negative prompts we evaluate our approach on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the tradeoffs between negative guidance strength and textimage alignment we propose a datadriven framework for efficiently solving quadratic programming qp problems by reducing the number of variables in highdimensional qps using instancespecific projection a graph neural networkbased model is designed to generate projections tailored to each qp instance enabling us to produce highquality solutions even for previously unseen problems the model is trained on heterogeneous qps to minimize the expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions this is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem the inner optimization solves the qp under a given projection using a qp solver while the outer optimization updates the model parameters we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this bilevel optimization problem which computes parameter gradients without backpropagating through the solver we provide a theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of solving qps with projection matrices generated by neural networks experimental results demonstrate that our method produces highquality feasible solutions with reduced computation time outperforming existing methods this paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond traditional parameter optimization unlike conventional approaches that search for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space our core idea is to treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity specifically we optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space to achieve this we construct a variational framework whose loss function carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of the manifold the former ensures the model effectively explains observed data while the latter acts as a regularizer penalizing overly curved or irregular geometries to encourage pler models and prevent overfitting to address the computational challenges of this infinitedimensional optimization problem we introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry the continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh and the metric tensor is parameterized by edge lengths enabling efficient optimization using automatic differentiation tools theoretical analysis reveals a profound analogy between our framework and the einsteinhilbert action in general relativity providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of datadriven geometry we further argue that even with fixed topology metric optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with fixed geometry this work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully dynamic metalearners capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and topology and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as scientific model discovery and robust representation learning specialized generalist models sgms aim to preserve broad capabilities while achieving expertlevel performance in target domains however traditional llm structures including transformer linear attention and hybrid models do not employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information in this paper we present nirvana an sgm with specialized memory mechanism linear time complexity and testtime task information extraction besides we propose the taskaware memory trigger trigger that flexibly adjusts memory mechanism based on the current tasks requirements in trigger each incoming sample is treated as a selfsupervised finetuning task enabling nirvana to adapt its taskrelated parameters on the fly to domain shifts we also design the specialized memory updater updater that dynamically memorizes the context guided by trigger we conduct experiments on both general language tasks and specialized medical tasks on a variety of natural language modeling benchmarks nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the existing llm structures to prove the effectiveness of trigger on specialized tasks we test nirvanas performance on a challenging medical task ie magnetic resonance imaging mri we posttrain frozen nirvana backbone with lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and mri images despite the frozen nirvana backbone trigger guides the model to adapt to the mri domain with the change of taskrelated parameters nirvana achieves higherquality mri reconstruction compared to conventional mri models as well as the models with traditional llms backbone and can also generate accurate preliminary clinical reports accordingly traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and higher emissions especially during peak periods while the shortest path first spf algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network it performs poorly in dynamic multivehicle settings often worsening congestion by routing all vehicles along identical paths we address dynamic vehicle routing through a multiagent reinforcement learning marl framework for coordinated networkaware fleet navigation we first propose adaptive navigation an a decentralized marl model where each intersection agent provides routing guidance based on i local traffic and ii neighborhood state modeled using graph attention networks gat to improve scalability in large networks we further propose hierarchical hubbased adaptive navigation hhan an extension of an that assigns agents only to key intersections hubs vehicles are routed hubtohub under agent control while spf handles microrouting within each hub region for hub coordination hhan adopts centralized training with decentralized execution ctde under the attentive qmixing aqmix framework which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions via attention hub agents use flowaware state features that combine local congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing experiments on synthetic grids and real urban maps toronto manhattan show that an reduces average travel time versus spf and learning baselines maintaining routing success hhan scales to networks with hundreds of intersections achieving up to improvement under heavy traffic these findings highlight the potential of networkconstrained marl for scalable coordinated and congestionaware routing in intelligent transportation systems the dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance based on average loss across all samples in some test set this amounts to averaging performance geospatially across the earth in weather and climate settings failing to account for the nonuniform distribution of human development and geography we introduce stratified assessments of forecasts over earth safe a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a set of predictions made over earth safe integrates various data domains to stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints territory usually country global subregion income and landcover land or water this allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual stratum of the different attributes eg the accuracy in every individual country to demonstrate its importance we utilize safe to benchmark a zoo of stateoftheart aibased weather prediction models finding that they all exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute we use this to seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different lead times for various climatic variables by moving beyond globallyaveraged metrics we for the first time ask where do models perform best or worst and which models are most fair to support further work in this direction the safe package is open source and available at despite the notable advancements and versatility of multimodal diffusion models such as texttoimage models their susceptibility to adversarial inputs remains underexplored contrary to expectations our investigations reveal that the alignment between textual and image modalities in existing diffusion models is inadequate this misalignment presents significant risks especially in the generation of inappropriate or notsafeforwork nsfw content to this end we propose a novel attack called promptrestricted multimodal attack prema to manipulate the generated content by modifying the input image in conjunction with any specified prompt without altering the prompt itself prema is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by solely creating adversarial images distinguishing itself from prior methods that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce nsfw content consequently prema poses a novel threat to the integrity of multimodal diffusion models particularly in imageediting applications that operate with fixed prompts comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of prema can videollms achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture the same event from different viewpoints to study this we introduce egoexocon consistency a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized egocentric and exocentric video pairs with humanrefined queries in natural language egoexocon asizes two temporal understanding tasks temporal verification and temporal grounding it evaluates not only correctness but consistency across viewpoints our analysis reveals two critical limitations of existing videollms models often fail to maintain consistency with results far worse than their singleview performances when naively finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints the models show improved consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view for improvements we propose viewgrpo a novel reinforcement learning framework that effectively strengthens viewspecific temporal reasoning while encouraging consistent comprehension across viewpoints our method demonstrates its superiority over naive sft and grpo especially for improving crossview consistency all resources will be made publicly available visionbased endtoend ee driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models mllms however current ee driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems furthermore existing openloop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multimodal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in longtail scenarios to address these gaps we introduce the waymo open dataset for endtoend driving wodee wodee contains driving segments imately hours specifically curated for challenging longtail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than concretely each segment in wodee includes the highlevel routing information ego states and degree camera views from surrounding cameras to evaluate the ee driving performance on these longtail situations we propose a novel openloop evaluation metric rater feedback score rfs unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs rfs measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches raterannotated trajectory preference labels we have released rater preference labels for all wodee validation set segments while the held out test set labels have been used for the wodee challenge through our work we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable robust and safe endtoend autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex realworld situations large

expose critical limitations in current llm capabilities for classlevel engineering offering actionable insights for enhancing context modelling documentation strategies and retrieval integration in production code assistance tools molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information however existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between molecules and their descriptions as they lack the ability to learn finegrained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases to address this limitation we introduce molbridge a novel moleculetext learning framework based on substructureaware alignments specifically we augment the original moleculedescription pairs with additional alignment signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases to effectively learn from these enriched alignments molbridge employs substructureaware contrastive learning coupled with a selfrefinement mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals experimental results show that molbridge effectively captures finegrained correspondences and outperforms stateoftheart baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks highlighting the significance of substructureaware alignment in moleculetext learning in this study we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a multivariate industrial time series focusing on a steam turbine system we evaluate the impact of change pointderived

underperformed compared to a ple random forest xgboost ensemble trained on segmented data the ensemble achieved an aucroc of fscore of and early detection within the defined time window our findings highlight that in scenarios with highly imbalanced and temporally uncertain data model plicity combined with optimized segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures offering greater robustness interpretability and operational utility while investment funds publicly disclose their objectives in broad terms their managers optimize for complex combinations of competing goals that go beyond ple riskreturn tradeoffs traditional approaches attempt to model this through multiobjective utility functions but face fundamental challenges in specification and parameterization we propose a generative framework that learns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring explicit utility specification our approach directly models the conditional probability of a funds portfolio weights given stock characteristics historical returns previous weights and a latent variable representing the funds strategy unlike methods based on reinforcement learning or imitation learning which require specified rewards or labeled expert objectives our ganbased architecture learns directly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data we validate our framework on a dataset of us equity mutual funds the learned representations successfully capture known investment styles such as growth and value while also revealing implicit manager objectives for instance we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of markowitzlike optimization they do so with heterogeneous realizations for turnover concentration and latent factors to analyze and interpret the endtoend model we develop a series of tests that explain the model and we show that the benchmarks expert labeling are contained in our models encoding in a linear interpretable way our framework provides a datadriven approach for characterizing investment strategies for applications in market ulation strategy attribution and regulatory oversight social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data capturing user behaviors textual content temporal dynamics and network structures analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as opinion dynamics community formation and information diffusion however discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory conceptually challenging and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization existing automated approaches though increasingly leveraging large language models llms remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis we present sia social insight agents an llm agent system that links heterogeneous multimodal data including raw inputs eg text network and behavioral data intermediate outputs mined analytical results and visualization artifacts through coordinated agent flows guided by a bottomup taxonomy that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques sia enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies to ensure multimodal integration it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies tabular textual and network data into a consistent flow its interactive interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace validate and refine the agents reasoning supporting both adaptability and

cleansing it more reliably flags noisy samples producing models trained on accsgdie cleaned data that outperform those cleaned with sgdie reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers providers and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs the rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of healthcare provided by the hospitals in thisproject we have used machine learning techniques like logistic regression random forest and support vector machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical factors that play a crucial role in predicting allcause readmissions as the health claims data is high dimensional we have used principal component analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building regression models we compared and evaluated these models based on the area under curve auc metric random forest model gave the highest performance followed by logistic regression and support vector machine models these models can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of

make results auditable and reproducible testtime alignment of large language models llms attracts attention because finetuning llms requires high computational costs in this paper we propose a new testtime alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on prelogits aisp on the basis of the samplingbased model predictive control with the stochastic control input aisp applies the gaussian perturbation into prelogits which are outputs of the penultimate layer so as to maximize expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation we demonstrate that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards aisp outperforms bestofn sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used samples and achieves higher rewards than other rewardbased testtime alignment methods as a new and promising approach existing machine unlearning mu works typically asize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to achieve knowledge removal however when deployed in realworld scenarios such solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical requirements such as full access to original datasets and model in contrast to the existing approaches we regard classification training as a sequential process where classes are learned sequentially which we call inductive approach unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence this is implemented by appending a projectionredistribution layer in the end of the model such an approach does not require full access to the original dataset or the model addressing the challenges of existing methods this enables modular and modelagnostic deployment as an output filter into existing classification pipelines with minimal alterations we conducted multiple experiments across multiple datasets including image cifar using cnnbased model and tabular datasets covertype using treebased model experiment results show consistently ilar output to a fully retrained model with a high computational cost reduction this demonstrates the applicability scalability and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the performance of the output in a more practical setting controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable artificial intelligence deployment current steering methods such as vector addition and directional ablation are constrained within a twodimensional subspace defined by the activation and feature direction making them sensitive to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to unintended interactions in activation space we introduce angular steering a novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating activations within a fixed twodimensional subspace by formulating steering as a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction angular steering provides continuous finegrained control over behaviors such as refusal and compliance we demonstrate this method using refusal steering emotion steering as use cases additionally we propose adaptive angular steering a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the target feature further enhancing stability and coherence angular steering generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified geometric rotation framework plifying parameter selection and maintaining model stability across a broader range of adjustments experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that angular steering achieves robust behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance underscoring its flexibility generalization and robustness compared to prior approaches code and artifacts are available at generative ai genai is rapidly transforming software engineering se practices influencing how se processes are executed as well as how software systems are developed operated and evolved this paper applies design science research to build a roadmap for genaiaugmented se the process consists of three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence including collaborative discussions from the fse software engineering workshop rapid literature reviews and external feedback sessions involving peers mcluhans tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to systematically capture the transforming effects of genai on se processes and software resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of genai augmentation in se and systematically characterizes their related research challenges and opportunities these insights are then consolidated into a set of future research directions by grounding the roadmap in a rigorous multicycle process and crossvalidating it among independent author teams and peers the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for analyzing how genai affects se processes methods and tools and for framing future research within this rapidly evolving area based on these findings the article finally makes ten predictions for se in the year diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions this capability has driven their application to highdimensional multiobjective blackbox optimization problem existing approaches often employ an external optimization loop such as an evolutionary algorithm to the diffusion model however these approaches treat the diffusion model as a blackbox refiner which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the diffusion generation process limiting their efficiency to address these challenges we propose the inferencetime multitarget generation img algorithm which optimizes the diffusion process at inferencetime to generate samples that ultaneously satisfy multiple objectives specifically our img performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according to the expected aggregated multiobjective values this weighted resampling strategy ensures the diffusiongenerated samples are distributed according to our desired multitarget boltzmann distribution we further derive that the multitarget boltzmann distribution has an interesting loglikelihood interpretation where it is the optimal solution to the distributional multiobjective optimization problem we implemented img for a multiobjective molecule generation task experiments show that img requiring only a single generation pass achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations notably our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance contrastive languageimage pretraining clip delivers strong cross modal generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space yet it persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects attributes and relations often behaving like a bagofwords matcher prior causal accounts typically model text as a single vector obscuring tokenlevel structure and leaving core phenomenasuch as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard negatives unexplained we address this gap with a tokenaware causal representation learning crl framework grounded in a sequential languagetoken scm our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text proving that clips contrastive objective can recover the modalinvariant latent variable under both sentencelevel and tokenlevel scms crucially token granularity yields the first principled explanation of clips compositional brittleness composition nonidentifiability we show the existence of pseudooptimal text encoders that achieve perfect modalinvariant alignment yet are provably insensitive to swap replace and add operations over atomic concepts thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as trueoptimal encoders the analysis further links languageside nonidentifiability to visualside failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition operators compound hardness motivating improved negative mining strategies adam kingma and ba is the de facto optimizer in deep learning yet its theoretical understanding remains limited prior analyses show that adam favors solutions aligned with ellinftygeometry but these results are restricted to the fullbatch regime in this work we study the implicit bias of incremental adam using one sample per step for logistic regression on linearly separable data and we show that its bias can deviate from the fullbatch behavior to illustrate this we construct a class of structured datasets where incremental adam provably converges to the ellmaxmargin classifier in contrast to the ellinftymaxmargin bias of fullbatch adam for general datasets we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the limiting behavior of incremental adam as beta to and we characterize its convergence direction via a datadependent dual fixedpoint formulation finally we prove that unlike adam signum bernstein et al converges to the ellinftymaxmargin classifier for any batch size by taking beta close enough to overall our results highlight that the implicit bias of adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset while signum remains invariant given a noisy linear measurement ax xi of a distribution px and a good imation to the prior px when can we sample from the posterior px mid posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for tasks such as inpainting deblurring and mri reconstruction and several heuristics attempt to imate it unfortunately imate posterior sampling is computationally intractable in general to sidestep this hardness we focus on local or global logconcave distributions px in this regime langevin dynamics yields posterior samples when the exact scores of px are available but it is brittle to scoreestimation error requiring an mgf bound subexponential error by contrast in the unconditional setting diffusion models succeed with only an bound on the score error we prove that combining diffusion models with an annealed variant of langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in polynomial time using merely an bound on the score error incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments in this paper we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery termed interventional constraints which differs fundamentally from interventional data while interventional data require direct perturbations of variables interventional constraints encode highlevel causal knowledge in the form of inequality constraints on causal effects for instance in the sachs dataset sachs et al akt has been shown to be activated by pip meaning pip exerts a positive causal effect on akt existing causal discovery methods allow enforcing structural constraints for example requiring a causal path from pip to akt but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as learning that pip inhibits akt interventional constraints bridge this gap by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs ensuring learned models respect known causal influences to formalize interventional constraints we propose a metric to quantify total causal effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained optimization task solved using a twostage constrained optimization method we evaluate our approach on realworld datasets and demonstrate that integrating interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures consistency with established findings making models more explainable but also facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be costly to identify reinforcement learning rl algorithms are designed to optimize problemsolving by learning actions that maximize rewards a task that becomes particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments even advanced rl algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in these conditions in applications such as searching for underwater pollution clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles auvs rl algorithms must navigate rewardsparse environments where actions frequently result in a zero reward this paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying classical rl approaches to efficiently operate in sparse randomized and nonstationary environments we systematically study a large number of modifications including hierarchical algorithm changes multigoal learning and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to prevent state revisits our results demonstrate that a modified monte carlobased approach significantly outperforms traditional qlearning and two exhaustive search patterns illustrating its potential in adapting rl to complex environments these findings suggest that reinforcement learning approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random nonstationary and rewardsparse environments multiorgan segmentation is a critical task in computeraided diagnosis while recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image segmentation huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their effectiveness in multiorgan segmentation to address these challenges we propose a spatial priorguided cross dual encoder network spgcdenet a novel twostage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multiorgan segmentation accuracy our spgcdenet consists of two key components a spatial prior network and a cross dual encoder network the prior network generates coarse localization maps that delineate the imate roi serving as spatial guidance for the dual encoder network the cross dual encoder network comprises four essential components a global encoder a local encoder a symmetric crossattention module and a flowbased decoder the global encoder captures global semantic features from the entire image while the local encoder focuses on features from the prior network to enhance the interaction between the global and local encoders a symmetric crossattention module is proposed across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features furthermore the flowbased decoder directly propagates highlevel semantic features from the final encoder layer to all decoder layers maximizing feature preservation and utilization extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of spgcdenet compared to existing segmentation methods furthermore ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy reinforcement learning rl is widely used to produce robust robotic manipulation policies but finetuning visionlanguageaction vla models with rl can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at intermediate steps in contrast imitation learning il is easy to train but often underperforms due to its offline nature in this paper we propose hiors a ple yet effective posttraining method that utilizes rejection sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness hiors stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during online finetuning and adopts a rewardweighted supervised training objective to provide dense intermediatestep supervision for systematic study we develop an asynchronous inferencetraining framework that supports flexible online humanintheloop corrections which serve as explicit guidance for learning errorrecovery behaviors across three realworld tasks and two embodiments hiors finetunes a pibase policy to master contactrich manipulation in just hours of realworld training outperforming rl and il baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency notably the finetuned policy exhibits strong testtime

both approaches employ static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal to address these issues this paper proposes a samplespecific cleanlabel backdoor watermarking ie ssclbw by training a unetbased watermarked sample generator this method generates unique watermarks for each sample fundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns the core innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three components target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness nontarget sample loss guarantees trigger reliability and perceptual ilarity loss maintains visual imperceptibility during ownership verification blackbox testing is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined backdoor behaviors extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential watermark removal attacks personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for smallsample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine however the costly trial data limit the prediction performance to address this issue we propose a crossfidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive fusion network cfkdafn which leverages abundant but lowfidelity ulation data to enhance predictions on scarce but highfidelity trial data cfkdafn incorporates a dualchannel knowledge distillation module to extract complementary knowledge from the lowfidelity model along with an attentionguided fusion module to dynamically integrate multisource information experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of cfkdafn over stateoftheart methods in prediction accuracy ranging from to and strong robustness to varying highfidelity dataset sizes furthermore we extend cfkdafn to an interpretable variant enabling the exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decisionmaking graph condensation gc has gained significant attention for its ability to synthesize smaller yet informative graphs however existing studies often overlook the robustness of gc in scenarios where the original graph is corrupted in such cases we observe that the performance of gc deteriorates significantly while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only limited effectiveness through both empirical investigation and theoretical analysis we reveal that gc is inherently an intrinsicdimensionreducing process synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity although this property is critical for effective gc performance it remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations to tackle this vulnerability and improve gc robustness we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data manifold and propose a novel manifoldconstrained robust graph condensation framework named mrgc specifically we introduce three graph data manifold learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth lowdimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity thereby preserving the classification complexity reduction capability of gc and ensuring robust performance under universal adversarial attacks extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of modelname across diverse attack scenarios identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the longterm negative impacts on software systems code review serves as an effective practice that enables developers to check their teammates code before integration into the codebase to streamline the generation of review comments various automated code review approaches have been proposed where llmbased methods have significantly advanced the capabilities of automated review generation however existing models primarily focus on generalpurpose code review their effectiveness in identifying and addressing securityrelated issues remains underexplored moreover adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues faces substantial challenges including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation metrics to address these limitations we propose securereviewer a new approach designed for enhancing llms ability to identify and resolve securityrelated issues during code review specifically we first construct a dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities leveraging this dataset we finetune llms to generate code review comments that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with our proposed secureaware finetuning strategy to mitigate hallucination in llms and enhance the reliability of their outputs we integrate the rag technique which grounds the generated comments in domainspecific security knowledge additionally we introduce securebleu a new evaluation metric designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security issues experimental results demonstrate that securereviewer outperforms stateoftheart baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments online social networks have transformed the ways in which political mobilization messages are disseminated raising new questions about how peer influence operates

hindering their ability to leverage tools efficiently driven by the essential components of tool usage grasping the desired outcome selecting the most suitable tool determining optimal tool orientation and executing precise manipulations we introduce a pioneering framework our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robots inverse kinematics solver empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions using tools of varying lengths by integrating a ulationlearned action trajectory with the tool we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired skills from ulation to realworld scenarios through comprehensive experimentation remarkably our extended inverse kinematics solver demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than cm furthermore our trained policy achieves a mean error of cm in ulation noteworthy our model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two distinct tools of different lengths this research provides an indication of potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool usage enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across diverse tasks developing trustworthy machine learning ml models requires their predicted probabilities to be wellcalibrated meaning they should reflect trueclass frequencies among calibration notions in multiclass classification strong calibration is the most stringent as it requires all predicted probabilities to be ultaneously calibrated across all classes however existing approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias predictions in sparse regions of the feature space are systematically miscalibrated this is especially relevant in highstakes settings such as healthcare where the sparse instances are exactly those most at risk of biased treatment in this work we address this main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration first we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its relationship with strong calibration second we theoretically analyze the pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local calibration third we propose a practical method for enhancing local calibration in neural networks which enforces alignment between predicted probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the jensenshannon distance finally we empirically validate our approach against existing multiclass calibration techniques while multiagent systems mas excel at complex tasks their growing autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation existing methods primarily focus on posthoc failure attribution lacking proactive realtime interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency to this end we introduce supervisoragent a lightweight and modular framework for runtime adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agents architecture triggered by an llmfree adaptive filter supervisoragent intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors guide inefficient behaviors and purify observations on the challenging gaia benchmark supervisoragent reduces the token consumption of the smolagent framework by an average of without compromising its success rate extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks math reasoning code generation and question answering and various sota foundation models validate the broad applicability and robustness of our approach the code is available at we introduce aeolus a largescale multimodal flight delay dataset designed to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of foundation models for tabular data existing datasets in this domain are typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation aeolus addresses this limitation by providing three aligned modalities i a tabular dataset with rich operational meteorological and airportlevel features for over million flights ii a flight chain module that models delay propagation along sequential flight legs capturing upstream and downstream dependencies and iii a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft crew and airport resource connections enabling crossflight relational reasoning the dataset is carefully constructed with temporal splits comprehensive features and strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine learning evaluation aeolus supports a broad range of tasks including regression classification temporal structure modeling and graph learning serving as a unified benchmark across tabular sequential and graph modalities we release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to facilitate adoption aeolus fills a key gap for both domainspecific modeling and generalpurpose structured data source code and data can be accessed at this paper presents a hierarchical pathplanning and control framework that combines a highlevel deep qnetwork dqn for discrete subgoal selection with a lowlevel twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient td controller for continuous actuation the highlevel module selects behaviors and subgoals the lowlevel module executes smooth velocity commands we design a practical reward shaping scheme direction distance obstacle avoidance action smoothness collision penalty time penalty and progress together with a

replanning efficiency in dynamic and partially observable environments experiments show improved success rate and sample efficiency over singlealgorithm baselines dqn or td alone and rulebased planners with better generalization to unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes code and evaluation scripts are available at the project repository machine unlearning mu aims to remove the influence of certain data points from a trained model without costly retraining most practical mu algorithms are only imate and their performance can only be assessed empirically care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as possible a common practice is to run the mu algorithm multiple times independently starting from the same trained model in this work we demonstrate that this practice can give highly nonrepresentative results because even for the same architecture and same dataset some mu methods can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model training we therefore recommend that empirical comp of mu algorithms should also reflect the variability across different model training seeds overtheair ota federated learning fl has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multipleaccess channel to aggregate model updates in a single use existing otafl designs largely enforce zerobias model updates by either assuming homogeneous wireless conditions equal path loss across devices or forcing zerobias updates to guarantee convergence under heterogeneous wireless scenarios however such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance moreover prior analyses of biased otafl largely address convex objectives while most modern ai models are highly nonconvex motivated by these gaps we study otafl with stochastic gradient descent sgd for general smooth nonconvex objectives under wireless heterogeneity we develop novel otafl sgd updates that allow a structured timeinvariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates we derive a finitetime stationarity bound expected time average squared gradient norm that explicitly reveals a biasvariance tradeoff to optimize this tradeoff we pose a nonconvex joint ota powercontrol design and develop an efficient successive convex imation sca algorithm that requires only statistical csi at the base station experiments on a nonconvex image classification task validate the approach the scabased design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior otafl baselines the expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the constrained memory capacity of modern gpus to mitigate this mixtureofexperts moe architectures activate only a small portion of parameters during inference significantly lowering both memory demand and computational overhead however conventional moe inference approaches which select active experts independently at each layer often introduce considerable latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and gpu memory in addition current crosslayer prediction strategies which are typically based on fixed steps lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and workloads thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness to address these challenges we present expertflow a runtime system for moe inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cacheaware routing expertflow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth parameter dimensionality and model feedback signals furthermore it incorporates a hybrid crosslayer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs by adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage behavior expertflow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency caused by expert swapins our evaluation demonstrates that expertflow reduces model stall time to less than of the baseline highlighting its capability to optimize moe inference under stringent memory constraints we introduce the general incentivesbased framework for fairness giff a novel approach for fair multiagent resource allocation that infers fair decisionmaking from standard value functions in resourceconstrained settings agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes our approach leverages the actionvalue qfunction to balance efficiency and fairness without requiring additional training specifically our method computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual advantage correction term to discourage overallocation to already welloff agents this approach is formalized within a centralized control setting where an arbitrator uses the giffmodified qvalues to solve an allocation problem empirical evaluations across diverse domains including dynamic ridesharing homelessness prevention and a complex job allocation taskdemonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover farsighted equitable policies the frameworks effectiveness is supported by a theoretical foundation we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower bound on the true fairness improvement and that its tradeoff parameter offers monotonic tuning our findings establish giff as a robust and principled framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve more equitable outcomes in complex multiagent systems in sequence modeling the parametric memory of atomic facts has been predominantly abstracted as a bruteforce lookup of cooccurrences between entities we contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how memory is stored we begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of the local cooccurrences specified during training instead the model must have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts encoding global relationships between all entities including noncooccurring ones this in turn has plified a hard reasoning task involving an ellfold composition into an easytolearn step geometric task from this phenomenon we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain we argue that the rise of such a geometry despite optimizing over mere local associations cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures counterintuitively an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more succinct than a bruteforce lookup of associations then by analyzing a connection to nodevec we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that in contrast to prevailing theories indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures this analysis also points to practitioners a visible headroom to make transformer memory more strongly geometric we hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition capacity discovery and unlearning quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency power and memory footprint of generative ai models however accuracy often degrades sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits recent work suggests that invertible linear transformations eg rotations can aid quantization by reparameterizing feature channels and weights in this paper we propose sequence transformation and mixed precision stamp quantization a novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the sequence dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data by keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher precision we can maintain model accuracy at lower average activations bitwidths we evaluate stamp on recent lvm and llm architectures demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization methods including recent feature transformations how can we explain the influence of training data on blackbox models influence functions ifs offer a posthoc solution by utilizing gradients and hessians however computing the hessian for an entire dataset is resourceintensive necessitating a feasible alternative a common approach involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data but this method often results in highly inconsistent if estimates due to the high variance in sample configurations to address this we propose two advanced sampling techniques based on features and logits these samplers select a small yet representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic distribution of features or logits thereby enhancing the accuracy of if estimations we validate our approach through class removal experiments a typical application of ifs using the fscore to measure how effectively the model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the remaining classes our method reduces computation time by and memory usage by or improves the fscore by compared to the baseline we propose vdroid a mobile gui task automation agent unlike previous mobile agents that utilize large language models llms as generators to directly generate actions at each step vdroid employs llms as verifiers to evaluate candidate actions before making final decisions to realize this novel paradigm we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifierdriven mobile agents the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefillingonly workflow to accelerate the verification process the pairwise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifiers decisionmaking capabilities and the scalable humanagent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale vdroid obtains a substantial task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks on androidworld on androidlab and on mobileagentbench surpassing existing agents by and respectively furthermore vdroid achieves a remarkably low latency of per step which is faster compared with existing mobile agents the source code is available at agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics which are coarse rely on manual design from experts and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors we propose autolibra a framework for agent evaluation that transforms openended human feedback eg if you find that the button is disabled dont click it again or this agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own into metrics for evaluating finegrained behaviors in agent trajectories autolibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agents behavior clustering ilar positive and negative behaviors and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples which can be used for prompting llmasajudge as evaluators we further propose two meta metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of induced metrics with open feedback coverage and redundancy through optimizing these metametrics we experimentally demonstrate autolibras ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents we also present two applications of autolibra in agent improvement first we show that autolibra serve human prompt engineers for diagonalize agent failures and improve prompts iterative moreover we find that autolibra can induce metrics for automatic optimization for agents which makes agents improve through selfregulation our results suggest that autolibra is a powerful taskagnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations and act to influence future observations this latter capacity is captured by empowerment which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial intelligence and cognitive science this former capacity however is equally foundational in what ways and to what extent can an agent be influenced by what it observes in this paper we ground this concept in a universal agentcentric measure that we refer to as plasticity and reveal a fundamental connection to empowerment following a set of desiderata on a suitable definition we define plasticity using a new informationtheoretic quantity we call the generalized directed information we show that this new quantity strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by massey while preserving all of its desirable properties under this definition we find that plasticity is well thought of as the mirror of empowerment the two concepts are defined using the same measure with only the direction of influence reversed our main result establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics we explore the implications of these findings and suggest that plasticity empowerment and their relationship are essential to understanding agency testtime scaling tts has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models llms verification plays a key role in tts ultaneously influencing reasoning performance and compute efficiency due to the quality and computational cost of verification in this work we challenge the conventional paradigms of verification and make the first attempt toward systematically investigating the impact of verification granularitythat is how frequently the verifier is invoked during generation beyond verifying only the final output or individual generation steps to this end we introduce variable granularity search vgsearch a unified algorithm that generalizes beam search and bestofn sampling via a tunable granularity parameter extensive experiments with vgsearch under varying compute budgets generatorverifier configurations and task attributes reveal that dynamically selecting can improve the compute efficiency and scaling behavior building on these findings we propose adaptive vgsearch strategies that achieve accuracy gains of up to over beam search and over bestofn while reducing flops by over we will opensource the code to support future research the rapid advancement of large language models llms has stimulated interest in multiagent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks however the practical advantages of multiagent collaboration approaches remain insufficiently understood existing evaluations often lack generalizability failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of realworld clinical practice and frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both singlellmbased and established conventional methods to address this critical gap we introduce medagentboard a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of multiagent collaboration singlellm and conventional approaches medagentboard encompasses four diverse medical task categories medical visual question answering lay summary generation structured electronic health record ehr predictive modeling and clinical workflow automation across text medical images and structured ehr data our extensive experiments reveal a nuanced landscape while multiagent collaboration demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios such as enhancing task completeness in clinical workflow automation it does not consistently outperform advanced single llms eg in textual medical qa or critically specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in tasks like medical vqa and ehrbased prediction medagentboard offers a vital resource and actionable insights asizing the necessity of a taskspecific evidencebased approach to selecting and developing ai solutions in medicine it underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multiagent collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains all code datasets detailed prompts and experimental results are opensourced at reinforcement learning rl has proven effective for finetuning large language models llms significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation a crucial factor influencing rl finetuning success is the training curriculum the order in which training problems are presented while random curricula serve as common baselines they remain suboptimal manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive to address these limitations we propose selfevolving curriculum sec an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the rl finetuning process our approach formulates curriculum selection as a nonstationary multiarmed bandit problem treating each problem category eg difficulty level or problem type as an individual arm we leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain at each training step the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the td method across three distinct reasoning domains planning inductive reasoning and mathematics our experiments demonstrate that sec significantly improves models reasoning capabilities enabling better generalization to harder outofdistribution test problems additionally our approach achieves better skill balance when finetuning ultaneously on multiple reasoning domains these findings highlight sec as a promising strategy for rl finetuning of llms this position paper argues that the theoretical inconsistency often observed among responsible ai rai metrics such as differing fairness definitions or tradeoffs between accuracy and privacy should be embraced as a valuable feature rather than a flaw to be eliminated we contend that navigating these inconsistencies by treating metrics as divergent objectives yields three key benefits normative pluralism maintaining a full suite of potentially contradictory metrics ensures that the diverse moral stances and stakeholder values inherent in rai are adequately represented epistemological completeness the use of multiple sometimes conflicting metrics allows for a more comprehensive capture of multifaceted ethical concepts thereby preserving greater informational fidelity about these concepts than any single plified definition implicit regularization jointly optimizing for theoretically conflicting objectives discourages overfitting to one specific metric steering models towards solutions with enhanced generalization and robustness under realworld complexities in contrast efforts to enforce theoretical consistency by plifying or pruning metrics risk narrowing this value diversity losing conceptual depth and degrading model performance we therefore advocate for a shift in rai theory and practice from getting trapped in inconsistency to characterizing acceptable inconsistency thresholds and elucidating the mechanisms that permit robust imated consistency in practice language interpretation is a compositional process in which the meaning of more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to sparql queries an open question is how systematic this interpretation process is toward this question in this paper we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of llms to interpret questions are actually compositional for this we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in dbpedia relying on lemon lexica for verbalization our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of llms to interpret structurally complex questions given that they have seen the atomic building blocks this allows us to evaluate to what degree llms are able to interpret complex questions for which they understand the atomic parts we conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and fewshot optimization techniques as well as finetuning our results show that performance in terms of macro degrades from over down to with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input the scores do not exceed for the dataset of lowest complexity we thus conclude that llms struggle to systematically and compositionally interpret questions and map them into sparql queries large language models llms have demonstrated remarkable progress through preferencebased finetuning which critically depends on the quality of the underlying training data while human feedback is essential for improving data quality it is costly and does not scale well in this paper we introduce refinenjudge an automated iterative approach that leverages a single llm as both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality unlike existing iterative refinement methods refinenjudge employs an llm to both generate refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement ensuring that every iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human annotation or a separate reward model at each step the llm refines a response and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer this process continues until the llm prefers the initial answer over the refinement indicating no further improvements this produces sequences of increasing quality preferencelabeled responses ideal for finetuning we demonstrate the effectiveness of refinenjudge across a range of public datasets spanning five corpora targeting tasks such as coding math and conversation models llama and llama finetuned on refinenjudgeenhanced datasets were preferred by llm judges in over of comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by gpt additionally we report performance gains on alpacaeval and alpacaeval and on mtbench our results indicate that refinenjudge produces highquality datasets and scalable model improvements we propose collabrec a multiagent framework designed to counteract popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations in our setting three llmbased agents personalization popularity and sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives a nonllm moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multiround negotiation ensuring each agents viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing spurious or repeated responses experiments on european city queries show that collabrec improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a singleagent baseline surfacing lesservisited locales that often remain overlooked this balanced contextaware approach addresses overtourism and better aligns with constraints provided by the user highlighting the promise of multistakeholder collaboration in llmdriven recommender systems we study how promptlevel inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models llms in instructional dialogue we introduce a symbolic scaffolding method paired with a shortterm memory schema designed to promote adaptive structured reasoning in socratic tutoring using controlled ablation across five system variants we evaluate model outputs via expertdesigned rubrics covering scaffolding responsiveness symbolic reasoning and conversational memory we present preliminary results using an llmbased evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric this enables scalable systematic comparisons across architectural variants in earlystage experimentation the preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors including abstraction adaptive probing and conceptual continuity these findings support a processinglevel account in which promptlevel cognitive scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in llms the accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models mllms generated predictions which can enable selective prediction and improve user confidence is challenging due to the diverse multimodal input paradigms we propose functionally equivalent sampling for trust assessment festa a multimodal input sampling technique for mllms that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings the proposed taskpreserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency through equivalent samples and sensitivity through complementary samples of the model festa uses only inputoutput access of the model blackbox and does not require ground truth unsupervised the experiments are conducted with various offtheshelf multimodal llms on both visual and audio reasoning tasks the proposed festa uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement relative improvement for visionllms and relative improvement for audiollms in selective prediction performance based on areaunderreceiveroperatingcharacteristic curve auroc metric in detecting mispredictions the code implementation is opensourced graphbased retrievalaugmented generation rag has become a widely studied approach for improving the reasoning accuracy and factuality of large language models llms however many existing graphbased rag systems overlook the high cost associated with llm token usage during graph construction hindering largescale adoption to address this we propose terag a ple yet effective framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost inspired by hipporag we incorporate personalized pagerank ppr during the retrieval phase and we achieve at least of the accuracy of widely used graphbased rag methods while consuming only of the output tokens with its low token footprint and efficient construction pipeline terag is wellsuited for largescale and costsensitive deployment scenarios recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of large language models llms contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss however such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior in this work we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions including evaluation protocols task categories and model architectures our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting under likelihoodbased metrics without generation pruning most layers preserves performance with only the initial few being critical by contrast generationbased evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining longrange coherence we further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers yet can be reshaped through distillation these results highlight that depth usage in llms is highly heterogeneous and contextdependent underscoring the need for task metric and modelaware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models there is a growing interest in universal multimodal embeddings ume where models are required to generate taskspecific representations while recent studies show that multimodal large language models mllms perform well on such tasks they treat mllms solely as encoders overlooking their generative capacity however such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning inspired by the proven effectiveness of chainofthought reasoning we propose a general thinkthenembed tte framework for ume composed of a reasoner and an embedder the reasoner mllm first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning this explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions our contributions are threefold first by leveraging a powerful mllm reasoner we achieve stateoftheart performance on the mmebv benchmark surpassing proprietary models trained on massive inhouse datasets second to reduce the dependency on large mllm reasoners we finetune a smaller mllm reasoner using highquality embeddingcentric reasoning traces achieving the best performance among opensource models with a absolute gain over recently proposed models third we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance geospatial data offers immense potential for understanding our planet however the sheer volume and diversity of this data along with its varied resolutions timescales and sparsity pose significant challenges for thorough analysis and interpretation this paper introduces earth ai a family of geospatial ai models and agentic reasoning that enables significant advances in our ability to unlock novel and profound insights into our planet this approach is built upon foundation models across three key domainsplanetscale imagery population and environmentand an intelligent geminipowered reasoning engine we present rigorous benchmarks showcasing the power and novel capabilities of our foundation models and validate that when used together they provide complementary value for geospatial inference and their synergies unlock superior predictive capabilities to handle complex multistep queries we developed a geminipowered agent that jointly reasons over our multiple foundation models along with large geospatial data sources and tools on a new benchmark of realworld crisis scenarios our agent demonstrates the ability to deliver critical and timely insights effectively bridging the gap between raw geospatial data and actionable understanding large language models llms have shown great promise in automating data analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating multioperation execution plans however existing llmagentbased analytics frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access offering little to no privacy protection in contrast federated analytics fa enables privacypreserving computation across distributed data sources but lacks support for natural language input and requires structured machinereadable queries in this work we present lafa the first system that integrates llmagentbased data analytics with fa lafa introduces a hierarchical multiagent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms them into optimized executable fa workflows a coarsegrained planner first decomposes complex queries into subqueries while a finegrained planner maps each subquery into a directed acyclic graph of fa operations using prior structural knowledge to improve execution efficiency an optimizer agent rewrites and merges multiple dags eliminating redundant operations and minimizing computational and communicational overhead our experiments demonstrate that lafa consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resourceintensive fa operations by a substantial margin this work establishes a practical foundation for privacypreserving llmdriven analytics that supports natural language input in the fa setting llmbased agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity rather than awaiting instruction they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously however evaluating proactivity is challenging current benchmarks are constrained to localized context limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons to address this gap we present probe proactive resolution of bottlenecks probe decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities searching for unspecified issues identifying specific bottlenecks and executing appropriate resolutions we apply probe to evaluate leading llms and popular agentic frameworks showing that even stateoftheart models struggle to solve this benchmark computing our consistent measurements across frontier llms and agents we find that the best endtoend performance of is achieved by both gpt and claude opus additionally we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems and expose promising future research directions the extraordinary capabilities of large language models llms such as chatgpt and gpt are in part unleashed by aligning them with reward models that are trained on human preferences which are often represented as rankings of responses to prompts in this paper we document the phenomenon of reward collapse an empirical observation where the prevailing rankingbased approach results in an identical reward distribution regardless of the prompts during the terminal phase of training this outcome is undesirable as openended prompts like write a short story about your best friend should yield a continuous range of rewards for their completions while specific prompts like what is the capital of new zealand should generate either high or low rewards our theoretical investigation reveals that reward collapse is primarily due to the insufficiency of the rankingbased objective function to incorporate promptrelated information during optimization this insight allows us to derive closedform expressions for the reward distribution associated with a set of utility functions in an asymptotic regime to overcome reward collapse we introduce a promptaware optimization scheme that provably admits a promptdependent reward distribution within the interpolating regime our experimental results suggest that our proposed promptaware utility functions significantly alleviate reward collapse during the training of reward models we introduce a novel interval bound propagation ibp approach for the formal verification of object detection models specifically targeting the intersection over union iou metric the approach has been implemented in an open source code named ibp iou compatible with popular abstract interpretation based verification tools the resulting verifier is evaluated on landing approach runway detection and handwritten digit recognition case studies comparisons against a baseline vanilla ibp iou highlight the superior performance of ibp iou in ensuring accuracy and stability contributing to more secure and robust machine learning applications chaosbased reinforcement learning cbrl is a method in which the agents internal chaotic dynamics drives exploration however the learning algorithms in cbrl have not been thoroughly developed in previous studies nor have they incorporated recent advances in reinforcement learning this study introduced twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradients td which is one of the stateoftheart deep reinforcement learning algorithms that can treat deterministic and continuous action spaces to cbrl the validation results provide several insights first td works as a learning algorithm for cbrl in a ple goalreaching task second cbrl agents with td can autonomously suppress their exploratory behavior as learning progresses and resume exploration when the environment changes finally examining the effect of the agents chaoticity on learning shows that there exists a suitable range of chaos strength in the agents model to flexibly switch between exploration and exploitation and adapt to environmental changes large language models llms especially those accessed via apis have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains however users without technical expertise often turn to untrustworthy thirdparty services such as prompt engineering to enhance their llm experience creating vulnerabilities to adversarial threats like backdoor attacks backdoorcompromised llms generate malicious outputs to users when inputs contain specific triggers set by attackers traditional defense strategies originally designed for smallscale models are impractical for apiaccessible llms due to limited model access high computational costs and data requirements to address these limitations we propose chainofscrutiny cos which leverages llms unique reasoning abilities to mitigate backdoor attacks it guides the llm to generate reasoning steps for a given input and scrutinizes for consistency with the final output any inconsistencies indicating a potential attack it is wellsuited for the popular apionly llm deployments enabling detection at minimal cost and with little data userfriendly and driven by natural language it allows nonexperts to perform the defense independently while maintaining transparency we validate the effectiveness of cos through extensive experiments on various tasks and llms with results showing greater benefits for more powerful llms artificial neural networks anns have become a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships in largescale datasets however their blackbox nature poses trustworthiness challenges in certain situations ensuring trust in predictions might require following specific partial monotonicity constraints however certifying if an alreadytrained ann is partially monotonic is challenging therefore anns are often disregarded in some critical applications such as credit scoring where partial monotonicity is required to address this challenge this paper presents a novel algorithm lipvor that certifies if a blackbox model such as an ann is positive based on a finite number of evaluations consequently since partial monotonicity can be expressed as a positivity condition on partial derivatives lipvor can certify whether an ann is partially monotonic to do so for every positively evaluated point the lipschitzianity of the blackbox model is used to construct a specific neighborhood where the function remains positive next based on the voronoi diagram of the evaluated points a sufficient condition is stated to certify if the function is positive in the domain unlike prior methods our approach certifies partial monotonicity without constrained architectures or piecewise linear activations therefore lipvor could open up the possibility of using unconstrained ann in some critical fields moreover some other properties of an ann such as convexity can be posed as positivity conditions and therefore lipvor could also be applied ai is not only a neutral tool in team settings it actively reshapes the social and cognitive fabric of collaboration we advance a unified framework of alignment in distributed cognition in humanai teams a process through which linguistic cognitive and social coordination emerge as human and ai agents coconstruct a shared representational space across two studies we show that exposure to aigenerated language shapes not only how people speak but also how they think what they attend to and how they relate to each other together these findings reveal how ai participation reorganizes the distributed cognitive architecture of teams ai systems function as implicit social forcefields our findings highlight the doubleedged impact of ai the same mechanisms that enable efficient collaboration can also erode epistemic diversity and undermine natural alignment processes we argue for rethinking ai in teams as a socially influential actor and call for new design paradigms that foreground transparency controllability and grouplevel dynamics to foster responsible productive humanai collaboration dialogue state tracking dst is a key part of taskoriented dialogue systems identifying important information in conversations however its accuracy drops significantly in spoken dialogue environments due to named entity errors from automatic speech recognition asr systems we introduce a ple yet effective data augmentation method that targets those entities to improve the robustness of dst model our novel method can control the placement of errors using keywordhighlighted prompts while introducing phonetically ilar errors as a result our method generated sufficient error patterns on keywords leading to improved accuracy in noised and lowaccuracy asr environments generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stresstesting models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data in engineering and safetycritical applications these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domainspecific or naturally imposed by physics or nature consider for example generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times this can be used to stresstest the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality to address these challenges we introduce constrained posterior sampling cps a diffusionbased sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update notably cps scales to a large number of constraints sim without requiring additional training we provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling empirically cps outperforms stateoftheart methods in sample quality and ilarity to real time series by around and respectively on realworld stocks traffic and air quality datasets despite the remarkable success of large language models llms evaluating their outputs quality regarding preference remains a critical challenge while existing works usually leverage a strong llm as the judge for comparing llms response pairwisely such a singleevaluator approach is vulnerable to cyclic preference ie output a is better than than but is better than a causing contradictory evaluation results to address this we introduce pged preference graph ensemble and denoise a novel approach that leverages multiple modelbased evaluators to construct preference graphs and then ensembles and denoises these graphs for acyclic noncontradictory evaluation results we provide theoretical guarantees for our framework demonstrating its efficacy in recovering the ground truth preference structure extensive experiments on ten benchmarks demonstrate pged superiority in three applications model ranking for evaluation response selection for testtime scaling and data selection for model finetuning notably pged combines small llm evaluators eg llamab mistralb qwenb to outperform strong ones eg qwenb showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing evaluation reliability and improving model performance passive tracking methods such as phone and wearable sensing have become dominant in monitoring human behaviors in modern ubiquitous computing studies while there have been significant advances in machinelearning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors eg physical activity recognition there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful highlevel contextaware insights that are required for various applications eg summarizing an individuals daily routine to bridge this gap experts often need to employ a contextdriven sensemaking process in realworld studies to derive insights this process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors we conducted three rounds of user studies with experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking we follow a humancentered design process to identify needs and design iterate build and evaluate vital insight vi a novel llmassisted prototype system to enable humanintheloop inference sensemaking and visualizations of multimodal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables using the prototype as a technology probe we observe experts interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and aisupported inferences to explore question and validate insights through this iterative process we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future aiaugmented visualization systems to better assist experts sensemaking processes in multimodal health sensing data this position paper defends posthoc explainability methods as legitimate tools for scientific knowledge production in machine learning addressing criticism of these methods reliability and epistemic status we develop a philosophical framework grounded in mediated understanding and bounded factivity we argue that scientific insights can emerge through structured interpretation of model behaviour without requiring complete mechanistic transparency provided explanations acknowledge their imative nature and undergo rigorous empirical validation through analysis of recent biomedical ml applications we demonstrate how posthoc methods when properly integrated into scientific practice generate novel hypotheses and advance phenomenal understanding in recent research adversarial attacks on person detectors using patches or static modelbased texture modifications have struggled with low success rates due to the flexible nature of human movement modeling the deformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge fortunately advancements in neural radiance fields nerf for dynamic human modeling offer new possibilities in this paper we introduce uvattack a groundbreaking approach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human actions we address the challenge above by leveraging dynamicnerfbased uv mapping uvattack can generate human images across diverse actions and viewpoints and even create novel actions by sampling from the smpl parameter space while dynamic nerf models are capable of modeling human bodies modifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural network parameters to tackle this uvattack generates uv maps instead of rgb images and modifies the texture stacks this approach enables realtime texture edits and makes the attack more practical we also propose a novel expectation over pose transformation loss eopt to improve the evasion success rate on unseen poses and views our experiments show that uvattack achieves a attack success rate against the fastrcnn model across varied poses in dynamic video settings significantly outperforming the stateoftheart advcamou attack which only had a asr moreover we achieve asr on the latest yolov detector in blackbox settings this work highlights the potential of dynamic nerfbased uv mapping for creating more effective adversarial attacks on person detectors addressing key challenges in modeling human movement and texture modification the code is available at finetuning large language models llms using diverse datasets is crucial for enhancing their overall performance across various domains in practical scenarios existing methods based on modeling the mixture proportions of data composition often struggle with data whose domain labels are missing imprecise or nonnormalized while methods based on data selection usually encounter difficulties in balancing multidomain performance to address these challenges in this work we investigate the role of data diversity in enhancing the overall abilities of llms by empirically constructing contrastive data pools and theoretically deriving explanations building upon the insights gained we propose a new method that gives the llm a dual identity an output model to cognitively probe and select data based on diversity reward as well as an input model to be tuned with the selected data extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domainundetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced llms we release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedbackdriven datamodel codesign for llms influence functions provide crucial insights into model training but existing methods suffer from large computational costs and limited generalization particularly recent works have proposed various metrics and algorithms to calculate the influence of data using language models which do not scale well with large models and datasets this is because of the expensive forward and backward passes required for computation substantial memory requirements to store large models and poor generalization of influence estimates to new data in this paper we explore the use of small neural networks which we refer to as the influencenetwork to estimate influence values achieving up to cost reduction our evaluation demonstrates that influence values can be estimated with models just the size of full language models we use and versions we apply our algorithm of estimating influence values called nncift neural networks for efficient instruction finetuning to the downstream task of subset selection for general instruction finetuning in our study we include four stateoftheart influence functions and show no compromise in performance despite large speedups between nncift and the original influence functions we provide an indepth hyperparameter analyses of nncift the code for our method can be found here to recognize and mitigate the harms of generative ai systems it is crucial to consider who is represented in the outputs of generative ai systems and how people are represented a critical gap emerges when naively improving who is represented as this does not imply bias mitigation efforts have been applied to address how people are represented we critically examined this by investigating gender representation in occupation across stateoftheart large language models we first show evidence suggesting that over time there have been interventions to models altering the resulting gender distribution and we find that women are more represented than men when models are prompted to generate biographies or personas we then demonstrate that representational biases persist in how different genders are represented by examining statistically significant word differences across genders this results in a proliferation of representational harms stereotypes and neoliberalism ideals that despite existing interventions to increase female representation reinforce existing systems of oppression humanai collaborative tools attract attentions from the data storytelling community to lower the expertise barrier and streamline the workflow the recent advance in largescale generative ai techniques eg large language models llms and texttoimage models has the potential to enhance data storytelling with their power in visual and narration generation after two years since these techniques were publicly available it is important to reflect our progress of applying them and have an outlook for future opportunities to achieve the goal we compare the collaboration patterns of the latest tools with those of earlier ones using a dedicated framework for understanding humanai collaboration in data storytelling through comparison we identify consistently widely studied patterns eg humancreator aiassistant and newly explored or emerging ones eg aicreator humanreviewer the benefits of these ai techniques and implications to humanai collaboration are also revealed we further propose future directions to hopefully ignite innovations collecting groundtruth rewards or human demonstrations for multistep reasoning tasks is often prohibitively expensive particularly in interactive domains such as web tasks we introduce selftaught lookahead stl a rewardfree framework that improves language modelbased value functions by reasoning explicitly about state transitions stl can be viewed as a chainofthought analogue of the value iteration algorithm instead of regressing directly on numeric values a value llm is trained to ulate a step of lookahead in natural language predicting the next action resulting state and rationale for its value thereby refining value estimates without any labeled data this selfsupervised procedure yields more accurate statevalue predictions which in turn enable lightweight search algorithms to expand fewer states while maintaining strong performance empirically stltrained value models built on moderately sized parameter openweight llms boost web agent success rates by achieving comparable performance with proprietary models stl also generalizes to multihop qa and math puzzles we find that stl enables small opensource models to guide efficient search reducing inference costs by integrating explicit reasoning with value learning large foundation models face challenges in acquiring transferable structured thinking abilities especially when supervised with rigid templates or crowdannotated instruction datasets unlike prior approaches we focus on a thinkingcentric data synthesis paradigm that enables models to evolve through selfgenerated cognitively guided data we propose mindgym a structured and scalable framework for question synthesis composed of cognitive thinking process injection which infuses highlevel reasoning objectives to shape the models synthesis behavior seed singlehop question synthesis generating atomic questions from diverse semantic types to encourage broader thinking and challenging multihop qa synthesis composing more complex multihop questions based on qa seeds for deeper reasoning detailed analysis shows that synthetic data generated by our method achieves higher average quality and lower quality variance compared to baseline sources highlighting that both highquality and selfcontained data are essential for effective thinkingoriented finetuning mindgym improves performance on six reasoning benchmarks achieving gains of up to on mathvision using only data samples and generalizable improvements across different model sizes and architectures mindgym underscores the viability of selfchallenging mechanisms in refining large model capabilities while minimizing human intervention and resource demands code and data are released to promote datacentric research into selfevolving foundation models driven by their internal reasoning capabilities current network training paradigms primarily focus on either centralized or decentralized data regimes however in practice data availability often exhibits a hybrid nature where both regimes coexist this hybrid setting presents new opportunities for model training as the two regimes offer complementary tradeoffs decentralized data is abundant but subject to heterogeneity and communication constraints while centralized data though limited in volume and potentially unrepresentative enables better curation and highthroughput access despite its potential effectively combining these paradigms remains challenging and few frameworks are tailored to hybrid data regimes to address this we propose a novel framework that constructs a model atlas from decentralized models and leverages centralized data to refine a global model within this structured space the refined model is then used to reinitialize the decentralized models our method synergizes federated learning to exploit decentralized data and model merging to utilize centralized data enabling effective training under hybrid data availability theoretically we show that our approach achieves faster convergence than methods relying solely on decentralized data due to variance reduction in the merging process extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms purely centralized purely decentralized and existing hybridadaptable methods notably our method remains robust even when the centralized and decentralized data domains differ or when decentralized data contains noise significantly broadening its applicability as language models improve and become capable of performing more complex tasks across modalities evaluating them automatically becomes increasingly challenging developing strong and robust taskspecific automatic metrics gets harder and humanannotated test sets which are expensive to create saturate more quickly a compelling alternative is to design reliable strategies to automate the creation of test data and evaluation but previous attempts either rely on preexisting data or focus solely on individual tasks we present zeroshot benchmarking zsb a framework for creating highquality benchmarks for any task by leveraging language models for both synthetic test data creation and evaluation zsb is ple and flexible it requires only the creation of a prompt for data generation and one for evaluation it is scalable to tasks and languages where collecting realworld data is costly or impractical it is modelagnostic allowing the creation of increasingly challenging benchmarks as models improve to assess the effectiveness of our framework we create benchmarks for five textonly tasks and a multimodal one general capabilities in four languages english chinese french and korean translation and general visionlanguage capabilities in english we then rank a broad range of open and closed systems on our benchmarks zsb rankings consistently correlate strongly with human rankings outperforming widelyadopted standard benchmarks through ablations we find that strong benchmarks can be created with open models and that judge model size and dataset variety are crucial drivers of performance we release all our benchmarks and code to reproduce our experiments and to produce new benchmarks the use of language models for automatically evaluating longform text llmasajudge is becoming increasingly common yet most llm judges are optimized exclusively for english with strategies for enhancing their multilingual evaluation capabilities remaining largely unexplored in the current literature this has created a disparity in the quality of automatic evaluation methods for nonenglish languages ultimately hindering the development of models with better multilingual capabilities to bridge this gap we introduce mprometheus a suite of openweight llm judges ranging from to parameters that can provide both direct assessment and pairwise comparison feedback on multilingual outputs mprometheus models outperform stateoftheart open llm judges on multilingual reward benchmarks spanning more than languages as well as on literary machine translation mt evaluation covering language pairs furthermore mprometheus models can be leveraged at decoding time to significantly improve generated outputs across all tested languages showcasing their utility for the development of better multilingual models lastly through extensive ablations we identify the key factors for obtaining an effective multilingual judge including backbone model selection and training on synthetic multilingual feedback data instead of translated data we release our models training dataset and code aidriven video analytics has become increasingly important across diverse domains however existing systems are often constrained to specific predefined tasks limiting their adaptability in openended analytical scenarios the recent emergence of vision language models vlms as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling openended video understanding reasoning and analytics nevertheless their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultralong video content which is prevalent in realworld applications to address this we introduce ava a vlmpowered system designed for openended advanced video analytics ava incorporates two key innovations the near realtime construction of event knowledge graphs ekgs for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams and an agentic retrievalgeneration mechanism that leverages ekgs to handle complex and diverse queries comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks lvbench and videommelong demonstrate that ava achieves stateoftheart performance attaining and accuracy respectivelysignificantly surpassing existing vlm and video retrievalaugmented generation rag systems furthermore to evaluate video analytics in ultralong and openworld video scenarios we introduce a new benchmark ava this benchmark comprises videos each exceeding hours in duration along with manually annotated diverse and complex questionanswer pairs on ava ava achieves toptier performance with an accuracy of the source code of ava is available at the ava benchmark can be accessed at generative artificial intelligence gen ai systems represent a critical technology with farreaching implications across multiple domains of society however their deployment entails a range of risks and challenges that require careful evaluation to date there has been a lack of comprehensive interdisciplinary studies offering a systematic comparison between opensource and proprietary closed generative ai systems particularly regarding their respective advantages and drawbacks this study aims to i critically evaluate and compare the characteristics opportunities and challenges of open and closed generative ai models and ii propose foundational elements for the development of an open public and safe gen ai framework as a methodology we adopted a combined approach that integrates three methods literature review critical analysis and comparative analysis the proposed framework outlines key dimensions openness public governance and security as essential pillars for shaping the future of trustworthy and inclusive gen ai our findings reveal that open models offer greater transparency auditability and flexibility enabling independent scrutiny and bias mitigation in contrast closed systems often provide better technical support and ease of implementation but at the cost of unequal access accountability and ethical oversight the research also highlights the importance of multistakeholder governance environmental sustainability and regulatory frameworks in ensuring responsible development selfsupervised learning ssl has become a powerful solution to extract rich representations from unlabeled data yet ssl research is mostly focused on clean curated and highquality datasets as a result applying ssl on noisy data remains a challenge despite being crucial to applications such as astrophysics medical imaging geophysics or finance in this work we present a fully selfsupervised framework that enables noiserobust representation learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream finetuning our method first trains an ssl denoiser on noisy data then uses it to construct a denoisedtonoisy data curriculum ie training first on denoised then noisy samples for pretraining a ssl backbone eg dinov combined with a teacherguided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to their denoised counterparts this process encourages the model to internalize noise robustness notably the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining plifying deployment on imagenetk with vitb under extreme gaussian noise sigma snr db our method improves linear probing accuracy by over dinov demonstrating that denoiserfree robustness can emerge from noiseaware pretraining the code is available at abductive learning abl integrates machine learning with logical reasoning in a loop a learning model predicts symbolic concept labels from raw inputs which are revised through abduction using domain knowledge and then fed back for retraining however due to the nondeterminism of abduction the training process often suffers from instability especially when the knowledge base is large and complex resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space while prior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space they typically treat the knowledge base as a static black box in this work we propose curriculum abductive learning cabl a method that explicitly leverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the abl training challenges cabl partitions the knowledge base into a sequence of subbases progressively introduced during training this reduces the abduction space throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in a stepwise smooth way experiments across multiple tasks show that cabl outperforms previous abl implementations significantly improves training stability convergence speed and final accuracy especially under complex knowledge setting reasoning ability a core component of human intelligence continues to pose a significant challenge for large language models llms in the pursuit of agi although model performance has improved under the training scaling law significant challenges remain particularly with respect to training algorithms such as catastrophic forgetting and the limited availability of novel training data as an alternative testtime scaling enhances reasoning performance by increasing testtime computation without parameter updating unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space we propose leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to the testtime scaling law we introduce latentseek a novel framework that enhances llm reasoning through testtime instancelevel adaptation ttia within the models latent space specifically latentseek leverages policy gradient to iteratively update latent representations guided by selfgenerated reward signals latentseek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks including gsmk math and aime across multiple llm architectures results show that latentseek consistently outperforms strong baselines such as chainofthought prompting and finetuningbased methods furthermore our analysis demonstrates that latentseek is highly efficient typically converging within a few iterations for problems of average complexity while also benefiting from additional iterations thereby highlighting the potential of testtime scaling in the latent space these findings position latentseek as a lightweight scalable and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of llms neural combinatorial optimisation nco is a promising learningbased approach for solving vehicle routing problems vrps without extensive manual design while existing constructive nco methods typically follow an appendingbased paradigm that sequentially adds unvisited nodes to partial solutions this rigid approach often leads to suboptimal results to overcome this limitation we explore the idea of insertionbased paradigm and propose learning to construct with insertionbased paradigm lcinsert a novel learningbased method for constructive nco unlike traditional approaches lcinsert builds solutions by strategically inserting unvisited nodes at any valid position in the current partial solution which can significantly enhance the flexibility and solution quality the proposed framework introduces three key components a novel model architecture for precise insertion position prediction an efficient training scheme for model optimization and an advanced inference technique that fully exploits the insertion paradigms flexibility extensive experiments on both synthetic and realworld instances of the travelling salesman problem tsp and capacitated vehicle routing problem cvrp demonstrate that lcinsert consistently achieves superior performance across various problem sizes large reasoning models lrms such as openai and deepseekr have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities by generating longer chains of thought demonstrating outstanding performance across a variety of tasks however this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in redundant reasoning during the generation process leading to high computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking although numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking they often rely on external interventions in this paper we propose a novel framework selfbraking tuning sbt which tackles overthinking from the perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process thus eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms we construct a set of overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a systematic method to detect redundant reasoning this method accurately identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates training signals for learning selfregulation behaviors building on this foundation we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an appropriate point experiments across mathematical benchmarks aime amc math gsmk demonstrate that our method reduces token consumption by up to while maintaining comparable accuracy to unconstrained models sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity between stated and implied sentiment the challenge is exacerbated when the implication may be relevant to a specific country or geographical region pragmatic metacognitive prompting pmp is a cognitioninspired technique that has been used for pragmatic reasoning in this paper we harness pmp for explainable sarcasm detection for australian and indian english alongside a benchmark dataset for standard english we manually add sarcasm explanations to an existing sarcasmlabeled dataset for australian and indian english called besstie and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them with flute a standard english dataset containing sarcasm explanations our approach utilising pmp when evaluated on two openweight llms gemma and llama achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies we also find that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate contextrelated failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval the focused contribution of our work is utilising pmp in generating sarcasm explanations for varieties of english reinforcement learning rl algorithms sample multiple solution attempts for each problem and reward them independently this optimizes for pass performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples this underutilizes the sampling capacity limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder examples as a fix we propose passatk policy optimization pkpo a transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of passk performance thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward when considered jointly our contribution is to derive novel low variance unbiased estimators for passk and its gradient in both the binary and continuous reward settings we show optimization with our estimators reduces to standard rl with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and efficient transformation function while previous efforts are restricted to kn ours is the first to enable robust optimization of passk for any arbitrary moreover instead of trading off pass performance for passk gains our method allows annealing during training optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass numbers alongside significant passk gains we validate our reward transformations on toy experiments which reveal the variance reducing properties of our formulations we also include realworld examples using the opensource llm gemma we find that our transformation effectively optimizes for the target furthermore higher values enable solving more and harder problems while annealing boosts both the pass and passk crucially for challenging task sets where conventional pass optimization stalls our passk approach unblocks learning likely due to better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual samples recently texttoimage diffusion models have been widely used for style mimicry and personalized customization through methods such as dreambooth and textual inversion this has raised concerns about intellectual property protection and the generation of deceptive content recent studies such as glaze and antidreambooth have proposed using adversarial noise to protect images from these attacks however recent purificationbased methods such as diffpure and noise upscaling have successfully attacked these latest defenses showing the vulnerabilities of these methods moreover present methods show limited transferability across models making them less effective against unknown texttoimage models to address these issues we propose a novel antimimicry method styleguard we propose a novel style loss that optimizes the stylerelated features in the latent space to make it deviate from the original image which improves modelagnostic transferability additionally to enhance the perturbations ability to bypass diffusionbased purification we designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers during training extensive experiments on the wikiart and celeba datasets demonstrate that styleguard outperforms existing methods in robustness against various transformations and purifications effectively countering style mimicry in various models moreover styleguard is effective on different style mimicry methods including dreambooth and textual inversion the code is available at academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific communication requiring the compression of longcontext interleaved documents into a single visually coherent page to address this challenge we introduce the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation which pairs recent conference papers with authordesigned posters and evaluates outputs on ivisual qualitysemantic alignment with human posters iitextual coherencelanguage fluency iiiholistic assessmentsix finegrained aesthetic and informational criteria scored by a vlmasjudge and notably ivpaperquizthe posters ability to convey core paper content as measured by vlms answering generated quizzes building on this benchmark we propose posteragent a topdown visualintheloop multiagent pipeline the aparser distills the paper into a structured asset library the bplanner aligns textvisual pairs into a binarytree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance and the cpaintercommenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using vlm feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment in our comprehensive evaluation we find that gpto outputsthough visually appealing at first glanceoften exhibit noisy text and poor paperquiz scores and we find that reader engagement is the primary aesthetic bottleneck as humandesigned posters rely largely on visual semantics to convey meaning our fully opensource variants eg based on the qwen series outperform existing odriven multiagent systems across nearly all metrics while using fewer tokens it transforms a page paper into a finalized yet editable pptx poster all for just these findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated postergeneration models the code and datasets are available at foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices however present models for long video generation have limited inherent world modeling capabilities due to two main challenges compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms we enhance imagetovideo models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models we propose video retrieval augmented generation vrag with explicit global state conditioning which significantly reduces longterm compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models in contrast naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrievalaugmented generation prove less effective for video generation primarily due to the limited incontext learning capabilities of current video models our work illuminates the fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling capabilities predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains a common approach involves collecting scenariospecific data and performing finetuning via backpropagation however the need to finetune for each new scenario is often impractical for deployment on edge devices to address this challenge we introduce paper an incontext learning icl framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables adaptation without finetuning on the scenariospecific data at inference time without requiring weight updates we propose a spatiotemporal ilaritybased example selection stes method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying ilar motion patterns at corresponding locations to further refine this selection we introduce predictionguided example selection pges which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory rather than relying solely on the past trajectory this approach allows the model to account for longterm dynamics when selecting examples finally instead of relying on small realworld datasets with limited scenario diversity we train our model on a largescale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging incontext examples extensive experiments demonstrate that trajicl achieves remarkable adaptation across both indomain and crossdomain scenarios outperforming even finetuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks project page ulationfree training frameworks have been at the forefront of the generative modelling revolution in continuous spaces leading to largescale diffusion and flow matching models however such modern generative models suffer from expensive inference inhibiting their use in numerous scientific applications like boltzmann generators bgs for molecular conformations that require fast likelihood evaluation in this paper we revisit classical normalizing flows in the context of bgs that offer efficient sampling and likelihoods but whose training via maximum likelihood is often unstable and computationally challenging we propose regression training of normalizing flows regflow a novel and scalable regressionbased training objective that bypasses the numerical instability and computational challenge of conventional maximum likelihood training in favour of a ple ellregression objective specifically regflow maps prior samples under our flow to targets computed using optimal transport couplings or a pretrained continuous normalizing flow cnf to enhance numerical stability regflow employs effective regularization strategies such as a new forwardbackward selfconsistency loss that enjoys painless implementation empirically we demonstrate that regflow unlocks a broader class of architectures that were previously intractable to train for bgs with maximum likelihood we also show regflow exceeds the performance computational cost and stability of maximum likelihood training in equilibrium sampling in cartesian coordinates of alanine dipeptide tripeptide and tetrapeptide showcasing its potential in molecular systems large language models llms have demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks through both posttraining and testtime scaling laws while prevalent testtime scaling approaches are often realized by using external reward models to guide the model generation process we find that only marginal gains can be acquired when scaling a model posttrained on specific reasoning tasks we identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution discrepancies between the specific posttrained generator and the general reward model to address this we propose a framework that incentivizes llms to selfverify their own answers by unifying answer generation and verification within a single reinforcement learning rl process we train models that can effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions the trained model can further scale its performance at inference time by verifying its generations without the need for external verifiers we train our selfverification models based on qwenmathb and deepseekrdistillqwenb demonstrating their capabilities across varying reasoning context lengths experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our models can not only improve posttraining performance but also enable effective testtime scaling the detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in structurebased drug design despite notable advances in recent years existing methods datasets and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges current datasets and methods are centered on individual proteinligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein introducing significant statistical bias ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods to address these issues we first introduce unisiteds the first uniprot unique proteincentric ligand binding site dataset which contains times more multisite data and times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets we then propose unisite the first endtoend ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching in addition we introduce average precision based on intersection over union iou as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction extensive experiments on unisiteds and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that ioubased average precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality and that unisite outperforms current stateoftheart methods in ligand binding site detection the dataset and codes will be made publicly available at visionlanguage models vlms have shown strong performance on texttoimage retrieval benchmarks however bridging this success to realworld applications remains a challenge in practice human search behavior is rarely a oneshot action instead it is often a multiround process guided by clues in mind that is a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image motivated by this gap we study the task of mental image retrieval mir which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multiround interactions with an image search engine central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear actionable feedback however existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback which can be ambiguous misleading or ineffective for users to refine the query to overcome this we propose genir a generative multiround retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusionbased image generation to explicitly reify the ai systems understanding at each round these synthetic visual representations provide clear interpretable feedback enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively we further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a highquality multiround mir dataset experimental results demonstrate that genir significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the mir scenario this work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method providing a foundation for future research in this direction establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential for deploying realworld applications while visionlanguageaction vla models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment their reliance on offline expert demonstrations critically limits their capacity for postdeployment refinement to mitigate this limitation we introduce action preference optimization apo a method designed to refine vla models by humanassisted preference alignment gathered through interaction with environments this method begins with a humanrobot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention however directly leveraging these interaction trajectories for preference optimization is nontrivial due to the challenges of irreversible robotic actions and token distribution mismatch to solve this apo proposes an adaptive reweighting algorithm with binary desirability signals derived from interaction empowering vla models effectively suppress failureprone actions while enhancing corrective action adaptation ultimately apo equips vla models with the crucial capability to learn from failure paving the way for their iterative refinement and reliable deployment in dynamic environments the experiments conducted in ulation and realworld scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our humanassisted framework across a variety of manipulation tasks we believe this work could bring insights for efficient and stable optimization of vla models through humanrobot collaboration the code and dataset are released at while visionlanguageaction models vlas have shown promising robotic behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks they achieve limited success rates when deployed on novel tasks out of the box to allow these policies to safely interact with their environments we need a failure detector that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop backtrack or ask for help however existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or a few specific tasks while generalist vlas require the detector to generalize and detect failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments in this paper we introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose safe a failure detector for generalist robot policies such as vlas we analyze the vla feature space and find that vlas have sufficient highlevel knowledge about task success and failure which is generic across different tasks based on this insight we design safe to learn from vla internal features and predict a single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure safe is trained on both successful and failed rollouts and is evaluated on unseen tasks safe is compatible with different policy architectures we test it on openvla pi and pifast in both ulated and realworld environments extensively we compare safe with diverse baselines and show that safe achieves stateoftheart failure detection performance and the best tradeoff between accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction more qualitative results and code can be found at the project webpage diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in highfidelity image synthesis and promptguided generative modeling however ensuring adequate diversity in generated samples of promptguided diffusion models remains a challenge particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a promptaware fashion across semantically ilar prompts recent methods have introduced guidance via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations in this work we extend the diversity measurebased approaches by proposing the scalable promptaware rny kernel entropy diversity guidance sparke method for promptaware diversity guidance sparke utilizes conditional entropy for diversity guidance which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on ilar prompts and enables promptaware diversity control while the entropybased guidance approach enhances promptaware diversity its reliance on the matrixbased entropy scores poses computational challenges in largescale generation settings to address this we focus on the special case of conditional latent rke score guidance reducing entropy computation and gradientbased optimization complexity from the on of general entropy measures to on the reduced computational complexity allows for diversityguided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on different prompts we numerically test the sparke method on several texttoimage diffusion models demonstrating that the proposed method improves the promptaware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant computational costs we release our code on the project page with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence large language models llms have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing nlp including content generation humancomputer interaction machine translation and code generation however their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety concerns in particular llmgenerated content can exhibit unsafe behaviors such as toxicity bias or misinformation especially in adversarial contexts which has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry although numerous studies have attempted to evaluate these risks a comprehensive and systematic survey on safety evaluation of llms is still lacking this work aims to fill this gap by presenting a structured overview of recent advances in safety evaluation of llms specifically we propose a fourdimensional taxonomy i why to evaluate which explores the background of safety evaluation of llms how they differ from general llms evaluation and the significance of such evaluation ii what to evaluate which examines and categorizes existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities including dimensions such as toxicity robustness ethics bias and fairness truthfulness and related aspects iii where to evaluate which summarizes the evaluation metrics datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations iv how to evaluate which reviews existing mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators and some evaluation frameworks that integrate the entire evaluation pipeline finally we identify the challenges in safety evaluation of llms and propose promising research directions to promote further advancement in this field we asize the necessity of prioritizing safety evaluation to ensure the reliable and responsible deployment of llms in realworld applications large language models llms have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics coding and reasoning yet their learning ability which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge remains underexplored in this work we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education specifically we decompose general learning ability into three distinct complementary dimensions learning from instructor acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance learning from concept internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts and learning from experience adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback we conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings such as i interaction improves learning ii conceptual understanding is scaleemergent and benefits larger models and iii llms are effective fewshot learners but not manyshot learners based on our framework and empirical findings we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of llms general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions it enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and humanlike models the rapid advancement of ai particularly large language models llms has raised significant concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions associated with model training and inference however existing tools for measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented lacking systematic metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among them this paper presents aimeter a comprehensive software toolkit for the measurement analysis and visualization of energy use power draw hardware performance and carbon emissions across ai workloads by seamlessly integrating with existing ai frameworks aimeter offers standardized reports and exports finegrained timeseries data to support benchmarking and reproducibility in a lightweight manner it further enables indepth correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement by addressing critical limitations in existing tools aimeter encourages the research community to weigh environmental impact alongside raw performance of ai workloads and advances the shift toward more sustainable green ai practices the code is available at human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes fast intuitive system thinking and slow deliberate system thinking while current large reasoning models lrms excel at system thinking their inability to perform fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency in this work we enable lrms to imate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed adjustment optimizing accuracyefficiency tradeoffs our approach addresses two key questions how to control thinking speed in lrms and when to adjust it for optimal performance for the first question we identify the steering vector that governs slowfast thinking transitions in lrms representation space using this vector we achieve the first representation editingbased testtime scaling effect outperforming existing promptbased scaling methods for the second question we apply realtime difficulty estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity combining these techniques we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning without any training or additional cost our plugin module delivers an average accuracy with token usage across leading lrms and advanced reasoning benchmarks all of our algorithms are implemented based on vllm and are expected to support broader applications and inspire future research as both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly conventional pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgetssuch as cosine learning rate schedulesare increasingly inadequate for largescale training recent alternatives including warmupstabledecay wsd schedules and weight averaging offer greater flexibility however wsd relies on explicit decay phases to track progress while weight averaging addresses this limitation at the cost of additional memory in search of a more principled and scalable alternative we revisit the schedulefree sf method defazio et al which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings we show that sfadamw effectively navigates the river structure of the loss landscape without decay phases or auxiliary averaging making it particularly suitable for continuously scaling training workloads to understand this behavior we conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of sf dynamics revealing that it implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead guided by this analysis we propose a refined variant of sf that improves robustness to momentum and performs better under large batch sizes addressing key limitations of the original method together these results establish sf as a practical scalable and theoretically grounded approach for language model training does visionandlanguage vl training change the linguistic representations of language models in meaningful ways most results in the literature have shown inconsistent or marginal differences both behaviorally and representationally in this work we start from the hypothesis that the domain in which vl training could have a significant effect is lexicalconceptual knowledge in particular its taxonomic organization through comparing minimal pairs of textonly lms and their vltrained counterparts we first show that the vl models often outperform their textonly counterparts on a textonly questionanswering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts mentioned in the questions using an array of targeted behavioral and representational analyses we show that the lms and vlms do not differ significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself but they differ in how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs a nontaxonomic relation this implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does not change substantially through additional vl training but vl training does improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic visual effects vfx are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern cinematic production although video generation models offer costefficient solutions for vfx production current methods are constrained by pereffect lora training which limits generation to single effects this fundamental limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite effects ie the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated locations however integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces major challenges interference from effect variations and spatial uncontrollability during multivfx joint training to tackle these challenges we propose omnieffects a first unified framework capable of generating promptguided effects and spatially controllable composite effects the core of our framework comprises two key innovations lorabased mixture of experts loramoe which employs a group of expert loras integrating diverse effects within a unified model while effectively mitigating crosstask interference spatialaware prompt sap incorporates spatial mask information into the text token enabling precise spatial control furthermore we introduce an independentinformation flow iif module integrated within the sap isolating the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted blending to facilitate this research we construct a comprehensive vfx dataset omnivfx via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and firstlast frametovideo flfv synthesis and introduce a dedicated vfx evaluation framework for validating model performance extensive experiments demonstrate that omnieffects achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation enabling users to specify both the category and location of desired effects speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference but its reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in largebatch serving environments with diverse requests this paper explores a new direction for dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of posthoc diagnostic signals we propose dynamic speculative decoding engine dsde a trainingfree framework built on two primary components a predictive signal based on the variance of the kullbackleibler kld divergence which diagnoses the generations regional stability and an adaptive speculation length cap to mitigate the straggler problem in persequence decoding experiments demonstrate the potential of using kldbased stability signals for dynamic adaptation an algorithm guided by these signals achieves endtoend latency competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across diverse workloads this robustness is particularly valuable in challenging lowacceptancerate regimes where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic utility collectively these findings validate posthoc signals as a valuable component for building more robust and intelligent llm inference systems and highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation length adaptation the growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep learningbased surgical training a key area of research a thorough understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial which semantic segmentation models can help achieve however most existing work focuses on surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects additionally current stateoftheart sota models struggle to balance capturing highlevel contextual features and lowlevel edge features we propose a featureadaptive spatial localization model faslseg designed to capture features at multiple levels of detail through two distinct processing streams namely a lowlevel feature projection llfp and a highlevel feature projection hlfp stream for varying feature resolutions enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and surgical instruments we evaluated faslseg on surgical segmentation benchmark datasets endovis and endovis on three use cases the faslseg model achieves a mean intersection over union miou of on parts and anatomy segmentation in endovis improving on sota by it further achieves a miou of and in endovis and endovis tool type segmentation respectively outperforming sota overall performance with comparable perclass sota results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for anatomy and instruments demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing streams for varying feature resolutions modern signal processing sp pipelines whether modelbased or datadriven often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data in contrast large language models llms offer strong reasoning capabilities broad generalpurpose knowledge incontext learning and crossmodal transfer abilities positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing sp workflows motivated by these potentials we introduce signalllm the first generalpurpose llmbased agent framework for general sp tasks unlike prior llmbased sp approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting signalllm introduces a principled modular architecture it decomposes highlevel sp goals into structured subtasks via incontext learning and domainspecific retrieval followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrievalaugmented generation rag and refinement these subtasks are then executed through promptbased reasoning crossmodal reasoning code synthesis model invocation or datadriven llmassisted modeling its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities task types and data conditions we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of signalllm through five representative tasks in communication and sensing such as radar target detection human activity recognition and text compression experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing llmbased methods particularly in fewshot and zeroshot settings uncovering causeandeffect mechanisms from data is fundamental to scientific progress while large language models llms show promise for enhancing causal discovery cd from unstructured data their application to the increasingly prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge even with the advent of multimodal llms mllms their efficacy in multimodal cd is hindered by two primary limitations difficulty in exploring intra and intermodal interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification and insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data to address these challenges we propose mllmcd a novel framework for multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data it consists of three key components a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample pairs a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal relationships among discovered factors and an iterative multimodal counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of mllms extensive experiments on both synthetic and realworld datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mllmcd in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships among them from multimodal unstructured data complexvalued signals encode both amplitude and phase yet most deep models treat attention as realvalued correlation overlooking interference effects we introduce the holographic transformer a physicsinspired architecture that incorporates wave interference principles into selfattention holographic attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes values ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase a dualheaded decoder ultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase we demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing experiments on polsar image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance achieving high classification accuracy and scores low regression error and increased robustness to phase perturbations these results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complexvalued learning and provides a unified physicsbased framework for coherent signal modeling the code is available at reinforcement learning with human feedback rlhf and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards rlvr are the main rl paradigms used in llm posttraining each offering distinct advantages however rlhf struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria whereas rlvr is limited in scope by its focus on correctnessbased verifiers we propose reinforcement learning with binary flexible feedback rlbff which combines the versatility of humandriven preferences with the precision of rulebased verification enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness rlbff extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion eg accuracy of information yes or code readability no from natural language feedback such principles can then be used to ground reward model training as an entailment task response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle we show that reward models trained in this manner can outperform bradleyterry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on rmbench and judgebench on leaderboard as of september additionally users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models in contrast to bradleyterry models finally we present a fully open source recipe including data to align qwenb using rlbff and our reward model to match or exceed the performance of omini and deepseek on general alignment benchmarks of mtbench wildbench and arena hard at of the inference cost models current models based on deep learning for lowdose ct denoising rely heavily on paired data and generalize poorly even the more concerned diffusion models need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction which is difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications at the same time selfsupervisedbased methods face the challenge of significant degradation of generalizability of models pretrained for the current dose to expand to other doses to address these issues this work proposes a novel method of tunablegeneralization diffusion turndiff powered by selfsupervised contextual subdata for lowdose ct reconstruction firstly a contextual subdata selfenhancing ilarity strategy is designed for denoising centered on the ldct projection domain which provides an initial prior for the subsequent progress subsequently the initial prior is used to combine knowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing image details the pretrained model is used for inference reconstruction and the pixellevel selfcorrecting fusion technique is proposed for finegrained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity using the initial prior and the ldct image as a guide in addition the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen doses dualdomain strategy cascade for selfsupervised ldct denoising turndiff requires only ldct projection domain data for training and testing comprehensive evaluation on both benchmark datasets and realworld data demonstrates that turndiff consistently outperforms stateoftheart methods in both reconstruction and generalization deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image synthesis however ensuring conditioning faithfulness and highquality synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge in this work we introduce a cycle training framework to finetune diffusion models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image realism our approach cycle diffusion model cdm enforces consistency between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation experiments on a combined brain mri dataset from abcd hcp aging young adults adni and ppmi show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image quality as measured by fid and ssim the results suggest that the cycle strategy used in cdm can be an effective method for refining diffusionbased medical image generation with applications in data augmentation counterfactual and disease progression modeling large language models llms tend to generate lexically semantically and stylistically homogenous texts this poses a risk of knowledge collapse where homogenous llms mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closedended multiplechoice setups or fuzzy semantic features and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts to overcome this we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity ie variation in realworld claims in llm outputs which we use to perform a broad empirical study of llm knowledge collapse we test llms topics covering countries and prompt variations sourced from real user chats for the topics in our study we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search we find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity while retrievalaugmented generation rag has a positive impact though the improvement from rag varies by the cultural context finally compared to a traditional knowledge source wikipedia we find that countryspecific claims reflect the english language more than the local one highlighting a gap in epistemic representation jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the builtin safety mechanisms of large language models automated jailbreaks typically optimize an adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response in this work we show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexitybased filtering on the input prompt to overcome this issue we propose latentbreak a whitebox jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity capable of evading such defenses latentbreak substitutes words in the input prompt with semanticallyequivalent ones preserving the initial intent of the prompt instead of adding highperplexity adversarial suffixes or long templates these words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless requests our extensive evaluation shows that latentbreak leads to shorter and lowperplexity prompts thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms against perplexitybased filters on multiple safetyaligned models on social media many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation si do not disclose their distress explicitly instead signs may surface indirectly through everyday posts or peer interactions detecting such implicit signals early is critical but remains challenging we frame early and implicit si as a forwardlooking prediction task and develop a computational framework that models a users information environment consisting of both their longitudinal posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers we adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a user and temporally aligned the users and neighbors interactions integrating the multilayered signals in a finetuned debertav model in a reddit study of case and control users our approach improves early and implicit si detection by over individualonly baselines these findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments dense video object captioning dvoc is the task of jointly detecting tracking and captioning object trajectories in a video requiring the ability to understand spatiotemporal details and describe them in natural language due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies potentially leading to suboptimal performance to circumvent this issue we propose to generate captions about spatiotemporally localized entities leveraging a stateoftheart vlm by extending the lvis and lvvis datasets with our synthetic captions lviscap and lvviscap we train maskcaptioner an endtoend model capable of jointly detecting segmenting tracking and captioning object trajectories moreover with pretraining on lviscap and lvviscap maskcaptioner achieves stateoftheart dvoc results on three existing benchmarks vidstg vln and bensmot the datasets and code are available at with the increasing ubiquity of arvr devices the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge these devices require realtime inference low power consumption and minimal latency many framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance we design a light framework that adopts an encoderdecoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy we apply sparse convolution on a resnet backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images achieving a endtoend efficiency improvement moreover we propose our splite decoder this new architecture significantly boosts the decoding processs frame rate by on the raspberry pi while maintaining accuracy on par to further optimize performance we apply quantizationaware training reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy pampjpe increases only marginally from mm to mm on freihand overall our system achieves a speedup on a raspberry pi cpu bcm quadcore arm a processor our method is also evaluated on compound benchmark datasets demonstrating comparable accuracy to stateoftheart approaches while significantly enhancing computational efficiency openvocabulary object detection ovd models offer remarkable flexibility by detecting objects from arbitrary text queries however their zeroshot performance in specialized domains like remote sensing rs is often compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language limiting critical downstream applications for instance an ovd model may struggle to distinguish between finegrained classes such as fishing boat and yacht since their embeddings are ilar and often inseparable this can hamper specific user goals such as monitoring illegal fishing by producing irrelevant detections to address this we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad generalization of a large pretrained ovd model with a lightweight fewshot classifier our method first employs the zeroshot model to generate highrecall object proposals these proposals are then refined for high precision by a compact classifier trained in realtime on only a handful of userannotated examples drastically reducing the high costs of rs imagery core of our framework is flame a onestep active learning strategy that selects the most informative samples for training flame identifies on the fly uncertain marginal candidates near the decision boundary using density estimation followed by clustering to ensure sample diversity this efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without costly fullmodel finetuning and enables instant adaptation within less then a minute which is significantly faster than stateoftheart method consistently surpasses stateoftheart performance on rs benchmarks establishing a practical and resourceefficient framework for adapting foundation models to specific user needs multimodal large languages models have been progressing from unimodal understanding toward unifying visual audio and language modalities collectively termed omni models however the correlation between unimodal and omnimodal remains unclear which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive omni models intelligence evolution in this work we introduce a novel highquality and unified omni model benchmark unobench this benchmark is designed to effectively evaluate both unimodal and omnimodal capabilities under a unified ability taxonomy spanning task types and modality combinations it includes human curated samples for omnimodal with crossmodality solvability and enhanced unimodal samples the humangenerated dataset is wellsuited to realworld scenarios particularly within the chinese context whereas the automatically compressed dataset offers a increase in speed and maintains consistency across public benchmarks in addition to traditional multichoice questions we propose an innovative multistep openended question format to assess complex reasoning a general scoring model is incorporated supporting question types for automated evaluation with accuracy experimental result shows the compositional law between omnimodal and unimodal performance and the omnimodal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak

unlocking new insights into disease prediction proactive health management risk stratification and personalized treatment strategies laying the groundwork for more personalized equitable and actionable realworld evidence generation in healthcare recent advances in texttovideo tv generation highlight the critical role of highquality videotext pairs in training models capable of producing coherent and instructionaligned videos however strategies for optimizing video captions specifically for tv training remain underexplored in this paper we introduce vcvg video captioning for video generation a comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of tv models we begin by analyzing caption content from a tv perspective decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into multiple dimensions and proposing a principled caption design methodology to support evaluation we construct vcvgbench a new benchmark featuring finegrained multidimensional and necessitygraded metrics aligned with tvspecific requirements extensive tv finetuning experiments demonstrate a strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation performance validating the effectiveness of our approach we release all benchmark tools and code at to support further research extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech signal processing mel frequency cepstral coefficients mfcc are the most widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition applications as the filtering in this feature is ilar to the filtering taking place in the human ear but the main drawback of this feature is that it provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the information about at what time which frequency is present the wavelet transform with its flexible timefrequency window provides time and frequency information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of nonstationary signals like speech on the other hand because of its uniform frequency scaling a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in analysing speech signals have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies and be less in line with human auditory perception hence it is necessary to develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both mfcc and wavelet transform a great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features the present wavelet transform based melscaled feature extraction methods require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of melscale filtering since it adds extra processing steps here we are proposing a method to extract mel scale features in time domain combining the concept of wavelet transform thus reducing the computational burden of timefrequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction combining our proposed time domain mel frequency wavelet coefficienttmfwc technique with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the efficiency of audio signal processing large language models sometimes produce structured firstperson descriptions that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience to better understand this behavior we investigate one theoretically motivated condition under which such reports arise selfreferential processing a computational motif asized across major theories of consciousness through a series of controlled experiments on gpt claude and gemini model families we test whether this regime reliably shifts models toward firstperson reports of subjective experience and how such claims behave under mechanistic and behavioral probes four main results emerge inducing sustained selfreference through ple prompting consistently elicits structured subjective experience reports across model families these reports are mechanistically gated by interpretable sparseautoencoder features associated with deception and roleplay surprisingly suppressing deception features sharply increases the frequency of experience claims while amplifying them minimizes such claims structured descriptions of the selfreferential state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any control condition the induced state yields significantly richer introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where selfreflection is only indirectly afforded while these findings do not constitute direct evidence of consciousness they implicate selfreferential processing as a minimal and reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured firstperson reports that are mechanistically gated semantically convergent and behaviorally generalizable the systematic emergence of this pattern across architectures makes it a firstorder scientific and ethical priority for further investigation in aphasia research speechlanguage pathologists slps devote extensive time to manually coding speech samples using correct information units cius a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is developing automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity for example only about transcripts are available in aphasiabank yet billions of tokens are used to train large language models llms in the broader field of machine learning ml researchers increasingly turn to synthetic data when such are sparse therefore this study constructs and validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the aphasiabank cat rescue picture description task one method leverages a procedural programming approach while the second uses mistral instruct and llama instruct llms the methods generate transcripts across four severity levels mild moderate severe very severe through word dropping filler insertion and paraphasia substitution overall we found compared to humanelicited transcripts mistral instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic degradation observed in aphasia showing realistic directional changes in ndw word count and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods based on the results future work should plan to create a larger dataset finetune models for better aphasic representation and have slps assess the realism and usefulness of the synthetic transcripts card games are widely used to study sequential decisionmaking under uncertainty with realworld analogues in negotiation finance and cybersecurity these games typically fall into three categories based on the flow of control strictly sequential players alternate single actions deterministic response some actions trigger a fixed outcome and unbounded reciprocal response alternating counterplays are permitted a lessexplored but strategically rich structure is the bounded onesided response where a players action briefly transfers control to the opponent who must satisfy a fixed condition through one or more moves before the turn resolves we term games featuring this mechanism bounded onesided response games borgs we introduce a modified version of monopoly deal as a benchmark environment that isolates this dynamic where a rent action forces the opponent to choose payment assets the goldstandard algorithm counterfactual regret minimization cfr converges on effective strategies without novel algorithmic extensions a lightweight fullstack research platform unifies the environment a parallelized cfr runtime and a humanplayable web interface the trained cfr agent and source code are available at ai search depends on linking large language models llms with vast external knowledge sources yet web pages pdf files and other raw documents are not inherently llmready they are long noisy and unstructured conventional retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw passages leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the llm this gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that redefines how models interact with documents we introduce the modeldocument protocol mdp a general framework that formalizes how raw text is bridged to llms through consumable knowledge representations rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching mdp defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into taskspecific llmready inputs these include agentic reasoning which curates raw evidence into coherent context memory grounding which accumulates reusable notes to enrich reasoning and structured leveraging which encodes documents into formal representations such as graphs or keyvalue caches all three pathways share the same goal ensuring that what reaches the llm is not raw fragments but compact structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning as an instantiation we present mdpagent which realizes the protocol through an agentic process constructing documentlevel gist memories for global coverage performing diffusionbased exploration with vertical exploitation to uncover layered dependencies and applying mapreduce style synthesis to integrate largescale evidence into compact yet sufficient context experiments on informationseeking benchmarks demonstrate that mdpagent outperforms baselines validating both the soundness of the mdp framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation realtime multimodal inference on resourceconstrained edge devices is essential for applications such as autonomous driving humancomputer interaction and mobile health however prior work often overlooks the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution as well as the complex intermodality dependencies in this paper we propose mmedge an new ondevice multimodal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs mmedge decomposes the entire inference process into a sequence of finegrained sensing and encoding units allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive mmedge also introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain accuracy performance such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for finegrained crossmodal optimization and early decisionmaking during inference to further enhance system performance under resource variability and input data complexity mmedge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for each modality under latency constraints and a crossmodal speculative skipping mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early predictions reach sufficient confidence we evaluate mmedge using two public multimodal datasets and deploy it on a realworld unmanned aerial vehicle uavbased multimodal testbed the results show that mmedge significantly reduces endtoend latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics the key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that measures the model fit to the training data the numerical methods to do this efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function the most decisive among these properties is the convexity or nonconvexity of the loss function the fact that the loss function can have and frequently has nonconvex regions has led to a widespread commitment to nonconvex methods such as adam however a local minimum implies that in some environment around it the function is convex in this environment secondorder minimizing methods such as the conjugate gradient cg give a guaranteed superlinear convergence we propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in realworld tasks swap from initial nonconvexity to convexity towards the optimum this is a property we leverage to design an innovative twophase optimization algorithm the presented algorithm detects the swap point by observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss in these regions nonconvex adam and convex cg algorithms are used respectively computing experiments confirm the hypothesis that this ple convexity structure is frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve convergence and accuracy the rapid advancement of large language modelsllms has intensified the need for domain and culture specific evaluation existing benchmarks are largely anglocentric and domainagnostic limiting their applicability to indiacentric contexts to address this gap we

map maintenance construction monitoring and reliable localization classical dsm differencing and image based methods are sensitive to small vertical bias ground slope and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise outputs without object identity point based neural models and voxel encodings demand large memory assume near perfect pre alignment degrade thin structures and seldom enforce class consistent association which leaves split or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty we propose an object centric uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale lidar that aligns epochs with multi resolution ndt followed by point to plane icp normalizes height and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious

observable markov decision processes pomdps maintaining and updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a principled way to summarize actionobservation history for effective decisionmaking under uncertainty as environments grow more realistic belief distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot accurately capture creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining representational accuracy despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic modeling existing pomdp belief imation methods fail to accurately represent complex uncertainty

or parametric methods with fixed representational capacity escort dynamically adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive distributional assumptions we demonstrate escorts effectiveness through extensive evaluations on both pomdp domains and synthetic multimodal distributions of varying dimensionality where it consistently outperforms stateoftheart methods in terms of belief imation accuracy and downstream decision quality supervised finetuning sft has emerged as a crucial method for aligning large language models llms with humanannotated demonstrations however sft being an offpolicy approach ilar to behavior cloning often struggles with overfitting and poor outofdomain generalization especially in limiteddata scenarios to address these limitations we propose selfrewarding ppo a novel finetuning method that leverages onpolicy techniques to enhance generalization performance our approach combines the strengths of sft and proximal policy optimization ppo to achieve more effective alignment from demonstration data at its core is a reward function designed as the log policy ratio between the sft model and the pretrained base model this function serves as an implicit reward signal using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the sft policy as a target by doing so it enables onpolicy finetuning without relying on human preference annotations the integration of this selfrewarding mechanism with ppo addresses key limitations of sft improving generalization data efficiency and robustness our empirical evaluation across a range of natural language processing tasks demonstrates that selfrewarding ppo consistently outperforms traditional sft methods the results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in aligning llms using demonstration data particularly in scenarios where highquality annotated data is scarce molecular property prediction mpp is a cornerstone of drug discovery and materials science yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large labeled datasets that are often unavailable fewshot molecular property prediction fsmpp addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property nodes but such moleculeproperty graphs offer limited structural guidance we propose a comprehensive solution motif driven globallocal context graph for fewshot molecular property prediction which enriches contextual information at both the global and local levels at the global level chemically meaningful motif nodes representing shared substructures such as rings or functional groups are introduced to form a global tripartite heterogeneous graph yielding motifmoleculeproperty connections that capture longrange compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with common motifs at the local level we build a subgraph for each node in the moleculeproperty pair and encode them separately to concentrate the models attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs experiments on five standard fsmpp benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms stateoftheart methods these results underscore the effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with finegrained local context to advance robust fewshot molecular property prediction intelligent drug recommendation based on electronic health records ehrs is critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical decisionmaking by leveraging largescale patient data drug recommendation systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications according to a patients medical history diagnoses laboratory results and comorbidities however the advancement of such systems is significantly hampered by the scarcity of publicly available realworld ehr datasets particularly in languages other than english in this work we present cdrugred a first publicly available chinese drug recommendation dataset focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases the dataset includes deidentified records from patients containing comprehensive information such as patient demographics medical history clinical course and discharge diagnoses we assess the utility of cdrugred by benchmarking several stateoftheart large language models llms on the discharge medication recommendation task experimental results show that while supervised finetuning improves model performance there remains substantial room for improvement with the best model achieving the score of and jaccard score of this result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug recommendation task and establishes cdrugred as a challenging and valuable resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems the dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data usage agreements at applying complex legal rules characterized by multiple heterogeneously

incorporating adaptive rag system to indonesian language adaptive rag system integrates a classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity which in turn determines the strategy for answering the question to overcome the limited availability of indonesian language dataset our study employs machine translation as data augmentation approach experiments show reliable question complexity classifier however we observed significant inconsistencies in multiretrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall evaluation when this strategy was applied these findings highlight both the promise and challenges of question answering in lowresource language suggesting directions for future improvement timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial for public safety and emergency response this study focuses on assessing the structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or shear cracks the amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an indication of structural damage and degradation to automatically detect exposed steel bars new datasets of images collected after the turkey earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete structures the proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework enhanced with finetuning data augmentation and testing on public datasets an automated

utilizing image data collection annotation and deep learning approaches policy optimization po is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning rl with diverse applications spanning robotics healthcare and large language model training the increasing deployment of po in sensitive domains however raises significant privacy concerns in this paper we initiate a theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization focusing explicitly on its sample complexity we first formalize an appropriate definition of differential privacy dp tailored to po addressing the inherent challenges arising from onpolicy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved in defining the unit of privacy we then systematically analyze the sample complexity of widelyused po algorithms including policy gradient pg natural policy gradient npg and more under dp constraints and various settings via a unified framework our theoretical results demonstrate that privacy costs can often manifest as lowerorder terms in the sample complexity while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private po settings these offer valuable practical insights for privacypreserving po algorithms

overall accuracy but underperforms at the lowfpr thresholds essential for practical use in contrast think off no reasoning during inference dominates in these precisionsensitive regimes with think on surpassing only when higher fprs are acceptable in addition we find tokenbased scoring substantially outperforms selfverbalized confidence for precisionsensitive deployments finally a ple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each taken together our findings position reasoning as a doubleedged tool beneficial for average accuracy but often illsuited for applications requiring strict

accountability as ai systems become more ubiquitous ensuring the transparency and correctness of aidriven decisions is crucial especially when they have direct consequences on privacy security or fairness verifiable ai powered by zeroknowledge machine learning zkml offers a robust solution to these challenges zkml enables the verification of ai model inferences without exposing sensitive data providing an essential layer of trust and privacy however traditional zkml systems typically require deep cryptographic expertise placing them beyond the reach of most ml engineers in this paper we introduce jstprove a specialized zkml toolkit built on polyhedra networks expander backend to enable ai developers and ml engineers to generate and verify proofs of ai inference jstprove provides an endtoend verifiable ai inference pipeline that hides cryptographic complexity behind a ple commandline interface while exposing auditable artifacts for reproducibility we present the design

engineering needs and as a reproducible foundation for future research and production deployments of verifiable ai accurate longterm forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains existing machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions to address these challenges we introduce a physicsconsistent neural operator pcno that enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto function spaces satisfying predefined laws a physicsconsistent projection layer within pcno efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in fourier space building upon deterministic predictions we further propose a diffusion

highfidelity spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions ranging from turbulent flow modeling to realworld floodatmospheric forecasting our twostage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate physically grounded and uncertaintyaware spatiotemporal forecasting generative ai tools are increasingly used to create portrayals of people in occupations raising concerns about how race and gender are represented we conducted a largescale audit of over million occupational personas across

inputs are encoded into spike trains and predictions are made by thresholding a single output neurons spike counts we also incorporate ple voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness to evaluate the framework we apply it with applicationspecific optimizations to the task of detecting low signaltonoise ratio radioactive sources in gammaray spectral data the resulting snns with as few as neurons and synapses achieve a true positive rate tpr at a false alarm rate of hr outperforming pca and deep learning baselines a threemodel anyvote ensemble increases tpr to at the same false

without domainspecific modification to seizure detection in eeg recordings an ensemble achieves tpr with a false positive rate comparable to recent deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong performance across diverse tasks through largescale pretraining and supervised finetuning however they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts and scarce labels where supervised finetuning may be infeasible while continued selfsupervised learning for model adaptation is common for generative language models this strategy has not proven effective for visioncentric encoder models to address this challenge we introduce a novel formulation of selfsupervised finetuning for vision foundation models where the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations leveraging only short multiview objectcentric videos our method is referred to as vessa videobased objectcentric selfsupervised adaptation for visual foundation models vessas training technique is based on a selfdistillation paradigm where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy

of mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination indicators the model also performs well and the results are balanced and stable with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark machine learning methods compared in summary the transformer model based on bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in this study can efficiently and accurately complete gpu memory demand prediction tasks in deep learning tasks and its prediction accuracy has been significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods this research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks and improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters large language models llms have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference posttraining quantization ptq can effectively reduce these demands by storing weights in lower bitwidth formats however standard uniform quantization often leads to notable performance degradation particularly in lowbit scenarios in this work we

dataset can be found in protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function making accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery protein engineering and precision medicine current approaches rely on finetuning proteinspecific transformers for individual datasets but struggle with crossdataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and limited target domain data we introduce two key innovations the first application of modelagnostic metalearning maml to protein mutation property prediction and a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context we build upon transformer architectures integrating them with maml to enable rapid adaptation to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning datasetspecific patterns our mutation encoding addresses the critical limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown tokens significantly degrading performance evaluation across three diverse protein mutation datasets functional fitness thermal stability and solubility demonstrates significant advantages over traditional finetuning in crosstask evaluation our metalearning approach achieves better accuracy for functional fitness with less training time and better accuracy for solubility with faster training the framework maintains consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size making it particularly valuable for industrial applications and earlystage protein design where experimental data is

contextdependent reasoning failures models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex openended tasks despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in ple contexts our work contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic longcontext evaluation providing an environment that mirrors the complexity and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as disease diagnosis treatment planning and disease development monitoring because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical structures that directly influence treatment decisions convolutional neural networks significantly impact image segmentation however since convolution operations are local capturing global contextual information and longrange dependencies is still challenging their capacity to precisely segment structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this restriction since transformers use selfattention methods to capture global context and longrange dependencies efficiently integrating transformerbased architecture with cnns is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges to address these challenges we propose the focal modulation and bidirectional feature fusion network for medical image segmentation referred to as fmbffnet in the remainder of this paper the network combines convolutional and transformer components employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to refine context awareness and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations across scales through this design fmbffnet enhances boundary precision and robustness to variations in lesion size shape and contrast extensive experiments on eight publicly available datasets including polyp detection skin lesion segmentation and ultrasound imaging show that fmbffnet consistently surpasses recent stateoftheart methods in jaccard index and dice coefficient confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse medical imaging scenarios this study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and landing systems in urban air mobility uam vehicles specifically it focuses on trojan attacks that target deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks cnns trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within a models training data these triggers cause specific failures under certain conditions while the model continues to perform normally in other situations we assessed the vulnerability of urban autonomous aerial vehicles uaavs using the dronet framework our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy from on clean data to on data triggered by trojan attacks to conduct this study we collected a custom dataset and trained models to ulate realworld conditions we also developed an evaluation framework designed to identify trojaninfected models this work demonstrates the potential security risks posed by trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for future research on enhancing the resilience of uam systems understanding adversarial behavior in cybersecurity has traditionally relied on highlevel intelligence reports and manual interpretation of attack chains however realtime defense requires the ability to infer attacker intent and cognitive strategy directly from lowlevel system telemetry such as intrusion detection system ids logs in this paper we propose a novel framework that leverages large language models llms to analyze suricata ids logs and infer attacker actions in terms of mitre attck techniques our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that attacker behavior reflects underlying cognitive biases such as loss aversion risk tolerance or goal persistence that can be extracted and modeled through careful observation of log sequences this lays the groundwork for future work on behaviorally adaptive cyber defense and cognitive trait inference we develop a strategydriven prompt system to segment large amounts of network logs data into distinct behavioral phases in a highly efficient manner enabling the llm to associate each phase with likely techniques and underlying cognitive motives by mapping networklayer events to highlevel attacker strategies our method reveals how

language models lms trained with reinforcement learning to produce longform natural language reasoning have been remarkably successful but they still require large amounts of computation and data to train and can be slow and expensive to run in this paper we show that standard instruct lms can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding rms eg deepseek vs without finetuning across diverse domains from instruction following and creative generation to mathematical reasoning this is achieved by codeadapt our ple recipe that combines the codeact framework where lms interleave natural language reasoning with code execution in a multistep fashion with fewshot bootstrap incontext learning from as few as five training

applications mark a significant advance toward generalpurpose controllable video generation adapterbased training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the capabilities of powerful foundation image generators enabling personalized and stylized texttoimage synthesis these adapters are typically trained to capture a specific target attribute such as subject identity using singleimage reconstruction objectives however because the input image inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors adapters are prone to entangle the target attribute with incidental ones such as pose expression and lighting this spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs the models ability to adhere to the input text prompt in this work we uncover a ple yet effective solution provide the very shortcuts we wish to eliminate during adapter training in shortcutrerouted adapter training confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules such as controlnet or lora eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them the auxiliary modules are then removed during inference when applied to tasks like facial and fullbody identity injection our approach improves generation quality diversity and prompt adherence these results point to a general design principle in the era of large models when seeking disentangled representations the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what should not be learned many highstakes applications of ai require forming datadriven hypotheses and making targeted guesses eg in scientific and diagnostic settings given limited resources to what extent do agents based on language models lms act rationally we develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic informationseeking drawing on insights from human behavior first we introduce a strategic decisionoriented dialogue task called collaborative battleship in which a partiallyinformed captain must balance exploration asking questions and action taking shots while a fullyinformed spotter must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck compared to human players we find that lm agents struggle to ground answers in context generate informative questions and select highvalue actions next to address these gaps we develop novel monte carlo inference strategies for lms based on principles from bayesian experimental design bed for spotter agents our approach boosts accuracy by up to absolute over lmonly baselines for captain agents it raises expected information gain eig by up to bits of the achievable noise ceiling combined

multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality imbalance where a dominant modality may overshadow others thereby hindering the learning of weak modalities conventional approaches often force weak modalities to align with dominant ones in learning to be the same positive learning which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak modalities to address this challenge we offer a new learning paradigm learning not to be negative learning instead of enhancing weak modalities targetclass predictions the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak modality to suppress nontarget classes this stabilizes the decision space and preserves modalityspecific information allowing weak modalities to preserve unique information without being overaligned we proceed to reveal multimodal learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the multimodal negative learning mnl framework which introduces a dynamic guidance mechanism tailored for negative learning our method provably tightens the robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the unimodal confidence margin ucom and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach against competing

reasoning in audio large language models remains widely underexplored as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than improves performance during inference a phenomenon we term testtime inverse scaling where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results we demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning itself but from inadequate training models without proper guidance for the reasoning process produce hallucinatory inconsistent reasoning that accumulates errors over longer chains to address these challenges we introduce cesar consistent

multimodal reasoning and perception capabilities overall cesar establishes a principled method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in audio llms the extent to which different neural or artificial neural networks models rely on equivalent representations to support ilar tasks remains a central question in neuroscience and machine learning prior work has typically compared systems using a single representational ilarity metric yet each captures only one facet of representational structure to address this we leverage a suite of representational ilarity metricseach capturing a distinct facet of representational correspondence such as geometry unitlevel tuning or linear decodabilityand assess brain region or model separability using multiple complementary measures metrics that preserve geometric or tuning structure eg rsa soft matching yield stronger regionbased discrimination whereas more flexible mappings such as linear predictivity show weaker separation these findings suggest that geometry and tuning encode brainregion or modelfamilyspecific signatures while linearly decodable information tends to be more globally shared across regions or models to integrate these complementary representational facets we adapt ilarity network fusion snf a framework originally developed for multiomics data integration snf produces substantially sharper regional and model familylevel separation than any single metric and yields robust composite ilarity profiles moreover clustering cortical regions using snfderived ilarity scores reveals a clearer hierarchical organization that aligns closely with established anatomical and functional hierarchies of the visual cortexsurpassing the correspondence achieved by individual metrics the presence of interictal epileptiform discharges ieds in electroencephalogram eeg recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy even trained neurologists find detecting ieds difficult leading many practitioners to turn to machine learning for help while existing machine learning algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task most models are uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions absent the ability to understand model reasoning doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly to improve the humanmodel interaction we introduce protoeegknn an inherently interpretable model that follows a ple casebased reasoning process protoeegknn reasons by comparing an eeg to ilar eegs from the training set and visually demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of ied morphology shape and spatial distribution location we show that protoeegknn can achieve stateoftheart accuracy in ied detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over existing approaches precisely defining consciousness and identifying the mechanisms that effect it is a longstanding question particularly relevant with advances in artificial intelligence the scientific community is divided between physicalism and natural dualism physicalism posits consciousness is a physical process that can be modeled computationally natural dualism rejects this hypothesis finding a computational model has proven elusive particularly because of conflation of consciousness with other cognitive capabilities exhibited by humans such as intelligence and physiological sensations here we show such a computational model that precisely models consciousness natural or artificial identifying the structural and functional mechanisms that effect it confirming the physicalism hypothesis we found such a model is obtainable when including the underlying biological or digital substrate and accounting for reactive behavior in substrate subsystems eg autonomous physiological responses results show that unlike all other computational processes consciousness is not independent of its substrate and possessing it is an evolutionary advantage for intelligent entities our result shows there is no impediment to the realization of fully artificial consciousness but surprisingly that it is also possible to realize artificial intelligence of arbitrary level without consciousness whatsoever and that there is no advantage in imbuing artificial systems with consciousness nowadays there has been a growing trend in the field of highenergy

illustrated for each application many rare diseases offer limited established treatment options leading patients to switch therapies when new medications emerge to analyze the impact of such treatment switches within the low sample size limitations of rare disease trials it is important to use all available data sources this however is complicated when usage of measurement instruments change during the observation period for example when instruments are adapted to specific age ranges the resulting disjoint longitudinal data trajectories complicate the application of traditional modeling approaches like mixedeffects regression we tackle this by mapping observations of each instrument to a aligned lowdimensional temporal trajectory enabling longitudinal modeling across instruments specifically we employ a set of variational autoencoder architectures to embed item values into a shared latent space for each time point temporal disease dynamics and treatment switch effects are then captured through a mixedeffects regression model applied to latent representations to enable statistical inference we present a novel statistical testing approach that accounts for the joint parameter estimation of mixedeffects regression and variational autoencoders the methodology is applied to quantify the impact of treatment switches for patients with spinal muscular atrophy here our approach aligns motor performance items from different measurement instruments for mixedeffects regression and maps estimated effects back to the observed item level to quantify the treatment switch effect our approach allows for model selection as well as for assessing effects of treatment switching the results highlight the potential of modeling in joint latent representations for addressing

competitive for medical image segmentation tasks offering a promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks yet getting a global conceptlevel understanding of how they function remains a key challenge many posthoc conceptbased approaches have been introduced to understand their workings yet they are not always faithful to the model further they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns such as classspecificity small spatial extent or alignment to human expectations in this work we put asis on the faithfulness of such conceptbased explanations and propose a new model with modelinherent mechanistic conceptexplanations our concepts are shared across classes and from any layer their contribution to the logit and their inputvisualization can be faithfully traced we also leverage foundation models to propose a new conceptconsistency metric cscore that can be used to evaluate conceptbased methods we show that compared to prior work our concepts are quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more interpretable all while retaining competitive imagenet performance large language models have gained remarkable interest in industry and academia the increasing interest in llms in academia is also reflected in the number of publications on this topic over the last years for instance alone of the around publications at icse performed experiments with llms conducting empirical studies with llms remains challenging and raises questions on how to achieve reproducible results for both other researchers and practitioners one important step towards excelling in empirical research on llms and their application is to first understand to what extent current research results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede reproducibility this investigation is within the scope of our work we contribute an analysis of the reproducibility of llmcentric studies provide insights into the factors impeding reproducibility and discuss suggestions on how to improve the current state in particular we studied the articles describing llmcentric studies published at icse and ase of the articles provided research artefacts and used openai models we attempted to replicate those studies of the studies only five were fit for reproduction for none of the five studies we were able to fully reproduce the results two studies seemed to be partially reproducible and three studies did not seem to be reproducible our results highlight not only the

solution for transforming unstructured text into actionable insights crucial for modern knowledge management and security operations ensuring that classifiers are wellcalibrated ie their predictions align with observed frequencies is a minimal and fundamental requirement for classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy existing methods for assessing multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with prediction eg topclass confidence classwise calibration or utilize computationally challenging variational formulations in this work we study scalable evaluation of multiclass calibration to this end we propose utility calibration a general framework that measures the calibration error relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision criteria relevant to the end user we demonstrate how this framework can unify and reinterpret several existing calibration metrics particularly allowing for more robust versions of the topclass and classwise calibration metrics and going beyond such binarized approaches toward assessing calibration for richer classes of downstream utilities large language models llms excel as passive responders but teaching them to be proactive goaloriented partners a critical capability in highstakes domains remains a major challenge current paradigms either myopically optimize singleturn attributes or rely on

a new challenging benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for formal mathematics the rapid advancement of large language models llms is positioning language at the core of humancomputer interaction hci we argue that advancing hci requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction particularly implicature meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared context which is essential for humanai hai alignment this study examines llms ability to infer user intent embedded in contextdriven prompts and whether understanding implicature improves response generation results show that larger models imate human interpretations more closely while smaller models struggle with implicature inference furthermore implicaturebased prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and quality of responses across models with notable gains in smaller models overall of participants preferred responses with implicatureembedded prompts to literal ones highlighting a clear preference for contextually nuanced communication our work contributes to understanding how linguistic theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making hai interaction more natural and contextually grounded diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for singleimage restoration but their application to zeroshot video restoration suffers from temporal inconsistencies due to the stochastic nature of sampling and complexity of incorporating explicit temporal modeling in this work we address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration using zeroshot imagebased diffusion models without retraining or modifying their architecture we propose two complementary inferencetime strategies perceptual straightening guidance psg based on the neuroscienceinspired perceptual straightening hypothesis which steers the diffusion denoising process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores such as frchet video distance fvd and perceptual straightness and multipath ensemble sampling mpes which aims at reducing stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity distortion scores such as psnr and ssim without sacrificing sharpness together these trainingfree techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable highfidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion models we performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and degradation

language models llms have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks from natural language understanding to code generation while they have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation the hallucination of nonexistent papers remains a major issue building on prior studies this study hypothesizes that an llms ability to correctly produce bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized with highly cited papers ie more frequently appear in the training corpus showing lower hallucination rates we therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy ie the frequency with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the pretraining corpus and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in llm outputs using gpt we generated and manually verified bibliographic records across twenty computerscience domains and measured factual consistency via cosine ilarity between generated and authentic metadata the results revealed that i hallucination rates vary across research domains ii citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy and iii bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond imately citations these findings suggest that highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization physicsinformed machine learning piml has successfully integrated mechanistic understanding into machine learning particularly in domains

challenges should not be seen as obstacles to piml but as catalysts for its evolution we propose biologyinformed machine learning biml a principled extension of piml that retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of biology rather than replacing piml biml retools its methods to operate under softer probabilistic forms of prior knowledge we outline four foundational pillars as a roadmap for this transition uncertainty quantification contextualization constrained latent structure inference and scalability foundation models and large language models will be key enablers bridging human expertise with computational modeling we conclude with concrete recommendations to build the biml ecosystem and channel pimlinspired innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance multiagent reinforcement learning marl has achieved strong results in cooperative tasks but typically assumes fixed fully controlled teams ad hoc teamwork aht relaxes this by allowing collaboration with unknown partners yet existing variants still presume shared conventions we introduce multilparty ad hoc teamwork maht where controlled agents must coordinate with multiple mutually unfamiliar groups of uncontrolled teammates to address this we propose mars which builds a sparse skeleton graph and applies relational modeling to capture crossgroup dvnamics experiments on mpe and starcralt ll show that mars outperforms marl and aht baselines while converging faster we present a novel task texttod sketch animation which aims to bring freeform sketches to life in dynamic space unlike prior works focused on photorealistic content generation we target sparse stylized and viewconsistent vector sketches a lightweight and interpretable medium wellsuited for visual communication and prototyping however this task is very challenging i no paired dataset exists for text and or sketches ii sketches require structural abstraction that is difficult to model with conventional representations like nerfs or point clouds and iii animating such sketches demands temporal coherence and multiview consistency which current pipelines do not address therefore we propose doodle the first trainingfree framework for generating dynamic sketches from text it leverages pretrained image and video diffusion models through a dualspace distillation scheme one space captures multiviewconsistent geometry using differentiable bzier curves while the other encodes motion dynamics via temporallyaware priors unlike prior work eg dreamfusion which optimizes from a single view per step our multiview optimization ensures structural alignment and avoids view ambiguity critical for sparse sketches furthermore we introduce a structureaware motion module that separates shapepreserving trajectories from deformationaware changes enabling expressive motion such as flipping rotation and articulated movement extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally realistic and structurally stable sketch animations outperforming existing baselines in both fidelity and controllability we hope this work serves as a step toward more intuitive and accessible content creation reinforcement learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy that maximizes expected return as a result the learned policy can exploit one or few reward sources however in many natural situations it is desirable to learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied to reaching a goal state this aspect remains relatively unexplored existing techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states other rl algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter to be available apriori this may be infeasible in large scale systems where enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a goal state only upon reaching it we formalize the problem of maximizing the expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as multi goal rl in which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states we propose a novel algorithm that learns a highreturn policy mixture with marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states our algorithm is based on optimizing a custom rl reward which is computed based on the current policy mixture at each iteration for a set of sampled trajectories the latter are used via an offline rl algorithm to update the policy mixture we prove performance guarantees for our algorithm showing efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state distribution over the goal states we design and perform experiments on synthetic mdps and standard rl environments to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic that benefits from embodied ai and vrar applications while transferring into hand articulatied object interaction haoi the hand grasps synthesis requires not only object functionality but also longterm manipulation sequence along the object deformation this paper proposes a novel haoi sequence generation framework synhlma to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated objects given a complete point cloud of an articulated object we utilize a discrete haoi representation to model each hand object interaction frame along with the natural language embeddings the representations are trained by an haoi manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its language description in a shared representation space a jointaware loss is employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated object joints in this way our synhlma achieves three typical hand manipulation tasks for articulated objects of haoi generation haoi prediction and haoi interpolation we evaluate synhlma on our built haoilang dataset and experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation performance comparing with stateoftheart we also show a robotics grasp application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning using the manipulation sequence provided by our synhlma our codes and datasets will be made publicly available normalization is fundamental to deep learning but existing approaches such as batchnorm layernorm and rmsnorm are variancecentric by enforcing zero mean and unit variance stabilizing training without controlling how representations capture taskrelevant information we propose ibinspired normalization ibnorm a ple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the information bottleneck principle ibnorm introduces bounded compression operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while suppressing nuisance variability yielding more informative representations while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization theoretically we prove that ibnorm achieves a higher ib value and tighter generalization bounds than variancecentric methods empirically ibnorm consistently outperforms batchnorm layernorm and rmsnorm across largescale language models llama gpt and vision models resnet vit with mutual information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior code will be released publicly recently convolutional filters have been increasingly adopted in sequential recommendation for their ability to capture local sequential patterns however most of these models complement convolutional filters with selfattention this is because convolutional filters alone generally fixed filters struggle to capture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation we propose timevariant convolutional filters for sequential recommendation tvrec a model inspired by graph signal processing where timevariant graph filters capture positiondependent temporal variations in user sequences by replacing both fixed kernels and selfattention with timevariant filters tvrec achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction patterns in user behavior this design not only eliminates the need for selfattention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference extensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that tvrec outperforms stateoftheart baselines by an average of bayesian inference of bayesian network structures is often performed by sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed markov chain we present two techniques to improve sampling first we give an efficient implementation of basic moves which add delete or reverse a single arc second we expedite summing over parent sets an expensive task required for more sophisticated moves we devise a preprocessing method to prune possible parent sets so as to imately preserve the sums our empirical study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared to previous methods wholebody humanoid motion represents a cornerstone challenge in robotics integrating balance coordination and adaptability to enable humanlike behaviors however existing methods typically require multiple training samples per motion category rendering the collection of highquality human motion datasets both laborintensive and costly to address this we propose a novel approach that trains effective humanoid motion policies using only a single nonwalking target motion sample alongside readily available walking motions the core idea lies in leveraging orderpreserving optimal transport to compute distances between walking and nonwalking sequences followed by interpolation along geodesics to generate new intermediate pose skeletons which are then optimized for collisionfree configurations and retargeted to the humanoid before integration into a ulated environment for policy training via reinforcement learning experimental evaluations on the cmu mocap dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines achieving superior performance across metrics code will be released upon acceptance expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions with the rapid advancement of aigenerated content aigc realistic and expressive facial animation has become increasingly crucial despite recent progress in speechdriven lipsync for talkingface animation generating emotionally expressive talking faces remains underexplored a major obstacle is the scarcity of real emotional talkingface datasets due to the high cost of data capture to address this we model facial animation driven by both speech and emotion as a linear additive problem leveraging a talkingface dataset with neutral expressions vocaset and a dataset of expression sequences florenced we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and emotion we introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture inherent secondary crossdomain deformations present in the training data the learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose parameters of the flame model enabling the animation of gaussian avatars qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate lip synchronization perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods without compromising lipsync quality this paper explores the integration of ai technologies into the artistic workflow through the creation of studies for a generative sound installation developed in collaboration with sound artist evala the installation employs specmaskgit a lightweight yet highquality sound generation ai model to generate and playback eightchannel sound in realtime creating an immersive auditory experience over the course of a threemonth exhibition the work is grounded in the concept of a new form of archive which aims to preserve the artistic style of an artist while expanding beyond artists past artworks by continued generation of new sound elements this speculative approach to archival preservation is facilitated by training the ai model on a dataset consisting of over hours of evalas past sound artworks by addressing key requirements in the cocreation of art using ai this study highlights the value of the following aspects the necessity of integrating artist feedback datasets derived from an artists past works and ensuring the inclusion of unexpected novel outputs in studies for the model was designed to reflect the artists artistic identity while generating new previously unheard sounds making it a fitting realization of the concept of a new form of archive we propose a humanai cocreation framework for effectively incorporating sound generation ai models into the sound art creation process and suggest new possibilities for creating and archiving sound art that extend an artists work beyond their physical existence demo page positiveunlabeled pu learning considers settings in which only positive and unlabeled data are available while negatives are missing or left unlabeled this situation is common in real applications where annotating reliable negatives is difficult or costly despite substantial progress in pu learning the multiclass case mpu remains challenging many existing approaches do not ensure unbiased risk estimation which limits performance and stability we propose a costsensitive multiclass pu method based on adaptive loss weighting within the empirical risk minimization framework we assign distinct datadependent weights to the positive and inferrednegative from the unlabeled mixture loss components so that the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk we formalize the mpu datagenerating process and establish a generalization error bound for the proposed estimator extensive experiments on eight public datasets spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes show consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability in a multistage recommendation system reranking plays a crucial role in modeling intralist correlations among items a key challenge lies in exploring optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations recent research follows a twostage generatorevaluator paradigm where a generator produces multiple feasible sequences and an evaluator selects the best one in practice the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model however these twostage methods face two main challenges first the separation of the generator and evaluator hinders endtoend training second autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency in this work we propose a unified generative efficient reranking framework gref to address the two primary challenges specifically we introduce genreranker an autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences subsequently we pretrain genreranker on the item exposure order for highquality parameter initialization to eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating sequencelevel evaluation during training for endtoend optimization we propose posttraining the model through rerankdpo moreover for efficient autoregressive inference we introduce ordered multitoken prediction omtp which trains genreranker to ultaneously generate multiple future items while preserving their order ensuring practical deployment in realtime recommender systems extensive offline experiments demonstrate that gref outperforms stateoftheart reranking methods while achieving latency that is nearly comparable to nonautoregressive models additionally gref has also been deployed in a realworld video app kuaishou with over million daily active users significantly improving online recommendation quality ai is displacing tasks mediating highstakes decisions and flooding communication with synthetic content unsettling work identity and social trust we argue that the decisive human countermeasure is resilience we define resilience across three layers psychological including emotion regulation meaningmaking cognitive flexibility social including trust social capital coordinated response organizational including psychological safety feedback mechanisms and graceful degradation we synthesize early evidence that these capacities buffer individual strain reduce burnout through social support and lower silent failure in aimediated workflows through team norms and riskresponsive governance we also show that resilience can be cultivated through training that complements rather than substitutes for structural safeguards by reframing the ai debate around actionable human resilience this article offers policymakers educators and operators a practical lens to preserve human agency and steer responsible adoption this paper addresses the critical challenges of communication overhead data heterogeneity and privacy in deep learning for channel state information csi feedback in massive mimo systems to this end we propose fedpelad a novel federated learning framework that incorporates personalized encoders and a loraadapted shared decoder specifically personalized encoders are trained locally on each user equipment ue to capture devicespecific channel characteristics while a shared decoder is updated globally via the coordination of the base station bs by using lowrank adaptation lora this design ensures that only compact lora adapter parameters instead of full model updates are transmitted for aggregation to further enhance convergence stability we introduce an alternating freezing strategy with calibrated learningrate ratio during lora aggregation extensive ulations on gppstandard channel models demonstrate that fedpelad requires only of the uplink communication cost compared to conventional methods while achieving a performance gain of db in csi feedback accuracy under heterogeneous conditions intrasentence multilingual speech synthesis codeswitching tts remains a major challenge due to abrupt language shifts varied scripts and mismatched prosody between languages conventional tts systems are typically monolingual and fail to produce natural intelligible speech in mixedlanguage contexts we introduce scriptfirst multilingual synthesis with adaptive locale resolution sfmsalr an engineagnostic framework for fluent realtime codeswitched speech generation sfmsalr segments input text by unicode script applies adaptive language identification to determine each segments language and locale and normalizes prosody using sentimentaware adjustments to preserve expressive continuity across languages the algorithm generates a unified ssml representation with appropriate lang or voice spans and synthesizes the utterance in a single tts request unlike endtoend multilingual models sfmsalr requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with existing voices from google apple amazon and other providers comparative analysis with datadriven pipelines such as unicom and mask lid demonstrates sfmsalrs flexibility interpretability and immediate deployability the framework establishes a modular baseline for highquality engineindependent multilingual tts and outlines evaluation strategies for intelligibility naturalness and user preference we present a transformerbased multimodal framework for generating clinically relevant captions for mri scans our system combines a deitsmall vision transformer as an image encoder medicarebert for caption embedding and a custom lstmbased decoder the architecture is designed to semantically align image and textual embeddings using hybrid cosinemse loss and contrastive inference via vector ilarity we benchmark our method on the multicare dataset comparing performance on filtered brainonly mris versus general mri images against stateoftheart medical image captioning methods including blip rgengpt and recent transformerbased approaches results show that focusing on domainspecific data improves caption accuracy and semantic alignment our work proposes a scalable interpretable solution for automated medical image reporting lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness as smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is confident in its prediction however identifying the worstcase adversarial examples is known to be an npcomplete problem although overimation methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this challenge reducing imation errors remains a significant obstacle furthermore these imation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight local lipschitz constants which are crucial for certified robustness originally grafting linearity into nonlinear activation functions was proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons enabling scalable and complete verification however no prior theoretical analysis has explained how linearity grafting improves certified robustness we instead consider linearity grafting primarily as a means of eliminating imation errors rather than reducing the number of unstable neurons since linear functions do not require relaxation in this paper we provide two theoretical contributions why linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the linfty local lipschitz constant and grafting linearity into nonlinear activation functions the dominant source of imation errors yields a tighter local lipschitz constant based on these theoretical contributions we propose a lipschitzaware linearity grafting method that removes dominant imation errors which are crucial for tightening the local lipschitz constant thereby improving certified robustness even without certified training our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into these influential activations tightens the linfty local lipschitz constant and enhances certified robustness many realworld datasets are both sequential and relational each node carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions existing methods in sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other we argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary facets of the same dataset and should be learned jointly we introduce bridge a unified endtoend architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a gnn under a single objective allowing gradients to flow across both modules and learning taskaligned representations to enable finegrained tokenlevel message passing among neighbors we add tokenxattn a tokenlevel crossattention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring sequences across two settings friendship prediction brightkite and fraud detection amazon bridge consistently outperforms static gnns temporal graph methods and sequenceonly baselines on ranking and classification metrics we present a datadriven dimensionality reduction method that is wellsuited for physicsbased data representing hyperbolic wave propagation the method utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural representation lrnr inside a hypernetwork framework the architecture is motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of efficient representations for this wave class we illustrate through archetypal examples that such an efficient lowdimensional representation of propagating waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning techniques we observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally in the trained lrnrs and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical features furthermore we demonstrate that the lrnr architecture enables efficient inference via a compression scheme which is a potentially important feature when deploying lrnrs in demanding performance regimes this paper introduces the neural differential manifold ndm a novel neural network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its fundamental design departing from conventional euclidean parameter spaces the ndm reconceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each layer functions as a local coordinate chart and the network parameters directly parameterize a riemannian metric tensor at every point the architecture is organized into three synergistic layers a coordinate layer implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired by normalizing flows a geometric layer that dynamically generates the manifolds metric through auxiliary subnetworks and an evolution layer that optimizes both task performance and geometric plicity through a dualobjective loss function this geometric regularization penalizes excessive curvature and volume distortion providing intrinsic regularization that enhances generalization and robustness the framework enables natural gradient descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear geometric meaning we analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach including its potential for more efficient optimization enhanced continual learning and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative modeling while significant computational challenges remain the neural differential manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically structured interpretable and efficient deep learning systems graph neural networks gnns excel on relational data by passing messages over node features and structure but they can amplify training data biases propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair outcomes many fairness methods treat bias as a single source ignoring distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and utility tradeoffs to overcome this challenge we propose fairmib a multiview information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into feature structural and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in gnns especially the proposed fairmib employs contrastive learning to maximize crossview mutual information for biasfree representation learning it further integrates multiperspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with sensitive attributes additionally fairmib introduces an inverse probabilityweighted ipw adjacency correction in the diffusion view which reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing experiments on five realworld benchmark datasets demonstrate that fairmib achieves stateoftheart performance across both utility and fairness metrics scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains unknown this study investigates the ability of large language models llms to identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature we define two categories of knowledge gaps explicit gaps clear declarations of missing knowledge and implicit gaps contextinferred missing knowledge while prior work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection we extend this line of research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps we conducted two experiments on almost documents across four datasets including a manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles we benchmarked both closedweight models from openai and openweight models llama and gemma under paragraphlevel and fullpaper settings to address the reasoning of implicit gaps inference we introduce small tabi a toulminabductive bucketed inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred conclusion candidates for validation our results highlight the robust capability of llms in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps this is true for both open and closedweight models with larger variants often performing better this suggests a strong ability of llms for systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps which can support earlystage research formulation policymakers and funding decisions we also report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment including domain adaptation humanintheloop verification and benchmarking across open and closedweight models the rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care robots however most existing systems are taskspecific and rely on handcrafted preprocessing limiting their ability to generalize across diverse scenarios a prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing which underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory signals inspired by this principle we introduce a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the freeenergy principle capable of directly integrating over dimensional visuoproprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction the model was able to learn two representative caregiving tasks rigidbody repositioning and flexibletowel wiping without taskspecific feature engineering we demonstrate three key properties i selforganization of hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions capture variability in uncertainty and infer occluded states ii robustness to degraded vision through visuoproprioceptive integration and iii asymmetric interference in multitask learning where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance while the model maintained overall robustness although the evaluation was limited to ulation these results establish predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle pointing toward robust flexible and autonomous caregiving robots while offering theoretical insight into the human brains ability to achieve flexible adaptation in uncertain realworld environments developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system alpr is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting rain and dust additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds varying camera angles and lowquality or lowresolution images alpr is vital in traffic control parking vehicle tracking toll collection and law enforcement applications this paper proposes a deep learning strategy using yolov for license plate detection and recognition tasks this method seeks to enhance the performance of the model using datasets from ontario quebec california and new york state it achieved an impressive recall rate of on the dataset from the center for pattern recognition and machine intelligence cenparmi and on the ufpralpr dataset in addition our method follows a semisupervised learning framework combining a small set of manually labeled data with pseudolabels generated by grounding dino to train our detection model grounding dino a powerful visionlanguage model automatically annotates many images with bounding boxes for license plates thereby minimizing the reliance on laborintensive manual labeling by integrating humanverified and modelgenerated annotations we can scale our dataset efficiently while maintaining label quality which significantly enhances the training process and overall model performance furthermore it reports character error rates for both datasets providing additional insight into system performance automatically configuring storage systems is hard parameter spaces are large and conditions vary across workloads deployments and versions heuristic and ml tuners are often system specific require manual glue and degrade under changes recent llmbased approaches help but

prototype implementation establishing a research agenda and practical design direction for applying intelligent data science techniques to semistructured and unstructured re data in collaborative environments mechanistic interpretability aims to reverseengineer large language models llms into humanunderstandable computational circuits however the complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required for specific reasoning tasks in this work we train small attentiononly transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the indirect object identification ioi task a benchmark for studying coreference like reasoning in transformers surprisingly a singlelayer model with only two attention heads achieves perfect ioi accuracy despite lacking mlps and normalization layers through residual stream decomposition spectral analysis and embedding interventions we find that the two heads specialize into additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement ioi resolution furthermore we show that a twolayer onehead model achieves ilar performance by composing information across layers through queryvalue interactions these results demonstrate that taskspecific training induces highly interpretable minimal circuits offering a controlled testbed for probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning in recent years machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care traditional approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin which limits the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment in this study we propose a novel approach that integrates both realtime seizure detection and prediction aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in eeg data that may indicate an upcoming seizure our approach was evaluated using the chbmit scalp eeg database which includes hours of recordings and seizures collected from pediatric and young adult patients with drugresistant epilepsy to support seizure detection we implemented a range of supervised machine learning algorithms including knearest neighbors logistic regression random forest and support vector machine the logistic regression achieved detection accuracy with recall demonstrating balanced performance suitable for clinical screening random forest and support vector machine models achieved higher accuracy but with recall failing to detect any seizures illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for evaluating medical ml models with class imbalance for seizure prediction we employed long shortterm memory lstm networks which use deep learning to model temporal dependencies in eeg data the lstm model achieved prediction accuracy these results highlight the potential of developing accessible realtime monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as traditionally done but also predict them before they occur this ability to predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to a more proactive approach allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications forget and rewire far methodology has demonstrated strong resilience against bitflip attacks bfas on transformerbased models by obfuscating critical parameters through dynamic rewiring of linear layers however the application of far introduces nonnegligible performance and memory overheads primarily due to the runtime modification of activation pathways and the lack of hardwarelevel optimization to overcome these limitations we propose faraccel a novel hardware accelerator architecture implemented on fpga specifically designed to offload and optimize far operations faraccel integrates reconfigurable logic for dynamic activation rerouting and lightweight storage of rewiring configurations enabling lowlatency inference with minimal energy overhead we evaluate faraccel across a suite of transformer models and demonstrate substantial reductions in far inference latency and improvement in energy efficiency while maintaining the robustness gains of the original far methodology to the best of our knowledge this is the first hardwareaccelerated defense against bfas in transformers effectively bridging the gap between algorithmic resilience and efficient deployment on realworld ai platforms diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning rl but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical notion of risk we introduce lrtdiffusion a riskaware sampling rule that treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the unconditional prior and the stateconditional policy head concretely we accumulate a loglikelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under to meet a userspecified typei level alpha this turns guidance from a fixed push into an evidencedriven adjustment with a userinterpretable risk budget importantly we deliberately leave training vanilla two heads with standard epsilonprediction under the structure of ddpm lrt guidance composes naturally with qgradients criticgradient updates can be taken at the unconditional mean at the lrtgated mean or a blend exposing a continuum from exploitation to conservatism we standardize states and actions consistently at train and test time and report a stateconditional outofdistribution ood metric alongside return on drl mujoco tasks lrtdiffusion improves the returnood tradeoff over strong qguided baselines in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha theoretically we establish levelalpha calibration concise stability bounds and a return comparison showing when lrt surpasses qguidanceespecially when offsupport errors dominate overall lrtdiffusion is a dropin inferencetime method that adds principled calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline rl pressure ulcers pus are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern accurate classification of pu severity stages iiv is essential for proper treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and subjective interpretation leading to variability among clinicians prior aibased approaches using convolutional neural networks cnns and vision

multimodal inputs ftarm advances the reliability transparency and clinical applicability of automated wound assessment systems addressing the critical need for consistent and explainable pu staging to support improved patient care vision transformers vits have emerged as powerful architectures in medical image analysis excelling in tasks such as disease detection segmentation and classification however their reliance on large attentiondriven models makes them vulnerable to hardwarelevel attacks in this paper we propose a novel threat model referred to as medhammer that combines the rowhammer hardware fault injection with neural trojan attacks to compromise the integrity of vitbased medical imaging systems specifically we demonstrate how malicious bit flips induced via rowhammer can trigger implanted neural trojans leading to targeted misclassification or suppression of critical diagnoses eg tumors or lesions in medical scans through extensive experiments on benchmark medical imaging datasets such as isic brain tumor and medmnist we show that such attacks can remain stealthy while achieving high attack success rates about and in mobilevit and swintransformer respectively we further investigate how architectural properties such as model sparsity attention weight distribution and the number of features of the layer impact attack effectiveness our findings highlight a critical and underexplored intersection between hardwarelevel faults and deep learning security in healthcare applications underscoring the urgent need for robust defenses spanning both model architectures and underlying hardware platforms a major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their inherent lowdimensional structure we introduce an approach to study the lowdimensional structure of language models at a modelagnostic level as sequential probabilistic models we first empirically demonstrate that a wide range of modern language models exhibit lowrank structure in particular matrices built from the models logits for varying sets of prompts and responses have low imate rank we then show that this lowrank structure can be leveraged for generation in particular we can generate a response to a target prompt using a linear combination of the models outputs on unrelated or even nonsensical prompts on the theoretical front we observe that studying the imate rank of language models in the sense discussed above yields a ple universal abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments we then analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning guarantees assessing scenario coverage is crucial for evaluating the robustness of autonomous agents yet existing methods rely on expensive human annotations or computationally intensive large visionlanguage models lvlms these approaches are impractical for largescale deployment due to cost and efficiency constraints to address these shortcomings we propose scout scenario coverage oversight and understanding tool a lightweight surrogate model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agents latent sensor representations scout is trained through a distillation process learning to imate lvlmgenerated coverage labels while eliminating the need for continuous lvlm inference or human annotation by leveraging precomputed perception features scout avoids redundant computations and enables fast scalable scenario coverage estimation we evaluate our method across a large dataset of reallife autonomous navigation scenarios demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost our results show that scout provides an effective and practical alternative for largescale coverage analysis while its performance depends on the quality of lvlmgenerated training labels scout represents a major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems despite their impressive performance visionlanguage models vlms still struggle on culturally situated inputs to understand how vlms process culturally grounded information we study the presence of culturesensitive neurons ie neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs associated with particular cultural contexts we examine whether such neurons are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they are located using the cvqa benchmark we identify neurons of culture selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by different identification methods experiments on three vlms across cultural groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures while having minimal effects on others moreover we propose a new marginbased selector contrastive activation selection cas and show that it outperforms existing probability and entropybased methods in identifying culturesensitive neurons finally our layerwise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to cluster in certain decoder layers overall our findings shed new light on the internal organization of multimodal representations we introduce kangcn a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling that places a kolmogorovarnold network kan as a featurewise calibrator before graph convolution networks gcns the kan front end applies learnable onedimensional warps and a linear mixing step improving feature conditioning and nonlinear encoding without increasing messagepassing depth we employ this architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet models our emulator is trained and tested using meltingrate ulations with meshsize settings for pine island glacier antarctica across to layer architectures kangcn matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure gcn and mlpgcn baselines despite a small parameter overhead kangcn improves inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edgewise messagepassing layer with a nodewise transform only the finest mesh shows a modest cost overall kanfirst designs offer a favorable accuracy vs efficiency tradeoff for large transient scenario sweeps requirements engineering increasingly occurs in multistakeholder environments where organizations ultaneously cooperate and compete creating coopetitive relationships in which trust evolves dynamically based on observed behavior over repeated interactions while conceptual modeling languages like i represent trust relationships qualitatively they lack computational mechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence conversely computational trust models from multiagent systems provide algorithmic updating but lack grounding in requirements engineering contexts and conceptual models this technical report bridges this gap by developing a computational trust model that extends gametheoretic foundations for strategic coopetition with dynamic trust evolution we introduce trust as a twolayer system with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation tracking violation history trust evolves through asymmetric updating where cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply creating hysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery we develop a structured translation framework enabling requirements engineers to instantiate computational trust models from i dependency networks and organizational contexts comprehensive experimental validation across parameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias hysteresis effects and cumulative damage amplification empirical validation using the renaultnissan alliance case study achieves out of validation points successfully reproducing documented trust evolution across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods this technical report builds upon its foundational companion work in multiview transformers such as dustr are revolutionizing vision by solving tasks in a feedforward manner however contrary to previous optimizationbased pipelines the inner mechanisms of multiview transformers are unclear their blackbox nature makes further improvements beyond data scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety and reliabilitycritical applications here we present an approach for probing and visualizing representations from the residual connections of the multiview transformers layers in this manner we investigate a variant of the

problem of payoff division in indivisible coalitional games where the value of the grand coalition is a natural number this number represents a certain quantity of indivisible objects such as parliamentary seats kidney exchanges or top features contributing to the outcome of a machine learning model the goal of this paper is to propose a fair method for dividing these objects among players to achieve this we define the indivisible shapley value and study its properties we demonstrate our proposed technique using three case studies in particular we use it to identify key regions of an image in the context of an image classification task the growing integration of artificial intelligence ai into human cognition raises a fundamental question does ai merely improve efficiency or does it alter how we think this study experimentally tested whether shortterm exposure to narrow ai tools enhances core cognitive abilities or ply optimizes task performance thirty young adults completed standardized neuropsychological assessments embedded in a sevenweek protocol with a fourweek online intervention involving problemsolving and verbal comprehension tasks either with or without ai support chatgpt while aiassisted participants completed several tasks faster and more accurately no significant prepost differences emerged in standardized measures of problem solving or verbal

designs that could sustain longterm identity and goal coherence in generative models flow matching has achieved remarkable success yet the factors influencing the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood in this work we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe the generation process laying down the formal connections between flow matching models and denoisers we provide a common ground to compare their performances on generation and denoising this enables the design of principled and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation noise and drift this leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative process enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters this study examines whether leading ai chatbot companies implement the responsible ai principles they publicly advocate the authors used a mixedmethods

multimodal intelligence across vision speech and language representing a key step toward artificial general intelligence agi compared to its predecessor the upgraded version exhibits substantial improvements across multimodal understanding and generation we significantly advance speech recognition capabilities achieving stateoftheart performance in contextual asr and highly competitive results in dialectaware asr in image generation mingflashomni introduces highfidelity text rendering and demonstrates marked gains in scene consistency and identity preservation during image editing furthermore mingflashomni introduces generative segmentation a capability that not only achieves strong standalone segmentation performance but also enhances spatial control in image generation and improves editing consistency notably mingflashomni achieves stateoftheart results in texttoimage generation and generative segmentation and sets new records on all contextual asr benchmarks all within a single unified architecture with the rapid advancement of texttoimage ti models ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical existing safety approaches can be categorized into trainingtime and inferencetime methods while inferencetime methods are widely adopted due to their costeffectiveness they often suffer from limitations such as overrefusal and imbalance between safety and utility to address these challenges we propose a multiround safety editing framework that functions as a modelagnostic plugandplay module enabling efficient safety alignment for any texttoimage model central to this framework is mrsafeedit a multiround imagetext interleaved dataset specifically constructed for safety editing in texttoimage generation we introduce a posthoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of identifying and refining unsafe content to instantiate this paradigm we develop safeeditor a unified mllm capable of multiround safety editing on generated

language models mllms has greatly advanced research into applications for video fake news detection vfnd tasks traditional videobased fnd benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the final decision often failing to provide finegrained assessments for the entire detection process making the detection process a black box therefore we introduce the mvfndb multimodal video fake news detection benchmark based on the empirical analysis which provides foundation for tasks definition the benchmark comprises tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe mllms perception understanding and reasoning capacities during detection featuring humanannotated videorelated questions based on a carefully constructed taxonomy ability of vfnd to validate the impact of combining multiple features on the final results we design a novel framework named mvfndcot which incorporates both creatoradded content and original shooting footage reasoning building upon the benchmark we conduct an indepth analysis of the deeper factors influencing accuracy including video processing strategies and the alignment between video features and model capabilities we believe this benchmark will lay a solid

combining swintiny features an extra trees classifier and lgbmbased feature selection achieves an accuracy of outperforming recent studies on the same dataset by these findings confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality evaluation tasks recent lightweight retrievalaugmented image caption models often utilize retrieved data solely as text prompts thereby creating a semantic gap by leaving the original visual features unenhanced particularly for object details or complex scenes to address this limitation we propose dualcap a novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual prompt from retrieved ilar images our model employs a dual retrieval mechanism using standard imagetotext retrieval for text prompts and a novel imagetoimage retrieval to source visually analogous scenes specifically salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually ilar scenes to capture key objects and ilar details these textual features are then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a lightweight trainable feature fusion network extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visualprompting captioning approaches reasoning methods such as chainofthought prompting and selfconsistency have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models across various reasoning tasks however such methods involve generation of lengthy reasoning chains which substantially increases token consumption computational cost and latency to address this inefficiency we propose proofsketch a verificationguided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic closure computation lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation our experiments show that proofsketch consistently reduces token usage while improving accuracy demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path for efficient and trustworthy reasoning factchecking on major platforms such as meta and tiktok is shifting from expertdriven verification to a communitybased setup where users contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading an important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for understanding realworld claims and the reasons why which remains largely underexplored in prior research in practice most community notes remain unpublished due to slow community annotation and the reasons for helpfulness lack clear definitions to bridge these gaps we introduce the task of predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this we present communitynotes a largescale multilingual dataset of posts with userprovided notes and helpfulness labels we further propose a framework that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic prompt optimization and integrate them into prediction our experiments show that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason prediction finally we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial for existing factchecking systems accurate quantification in positron emission tomography pet is essential for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking a major issue encountered in pet imaging is attenuation attenuation refers to the diminution of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching detectors when such corrections are absent or inadequate this signal degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification making it difficult to differentiate benign from malignant conditions and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis typically this correction is done with cocomputed computed tomography ct imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon attenuation across the body however this methodology subjects patients to extra ionizing radiation exposure suffers from potential spatial misregistration between petct imaging sequences and demands costly equipment infrastructure emerging advances in neural network architectures present an alternative approach via synthetic ct image synthesis our investigation reveals that conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models ddpms can generate high quality ct images from non attenuation corrected pet images in order to correct attenuation by utilizing all three orthogonal views from nonattenuationcorrected pet images the ddpm approach combined with ensemble voting generates higher quality pseudoct images with reduced artifacts and improved slicetoslice consistency results from a study of head scans acquired with the siemens biograph vision petct scanner demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudoct generation the method achieved a mean absolute error of pm hu on the ct images and an average error of pm across all regions of interest when comparing pet images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated pseudoct versus the true ct practical deployment of multiagent systems mas demands strong testtime performance motivating

reasoning code understanding and replicating human mobility requires not only spatialtemporal accuracy but also an awareness of the cognitive hierarchy underlying realworld travel decisions traditional agentbased or deep learning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to capture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior large language models llms show potential but struggle to balance creative reasoning with strict structural compliance this study proposes a hierarchical llmagent framework termed narrativetoaction that integrates highlevel narrative reasoning midlevel reflective planning and lowlevel behavioral execution within a unified cognitive hierarchy at the macro level one agent is employed as a creative writer to produce diarystyle narratives rich in motivation and context then uses another agent as a structural parser to convert narratives into machinereadable plans a dynamic execution module further grounds agents

across different occupational personalities at the micro level the agent executes concrete actionsselecting locations transportation modes and time intervalsthrough interaction with an environmental ulation by embedding this multilayer cognitive process the framework produces not only synthetic trajectories that align closely with realworld patterns but also interpretable representations of human decision logic this research advances synthetic mobility generation from a datadriven paradigm to a cognitiondriven ulation providing a scalable pathway for understanding predicting and synthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical llm agents as centralized ai hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from everlarger training runs meeting demand requires an inference

inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or security the rapid evolution of large language models llms creates complex bidirectional expectations between users and ai systems that are poorly understood we introduce the concept of mutual wanting to analyze these expectations during major model transitions through analysis of user comments from major ai forums and controlled experiments across multiple openai models we provide the first largescale empirical validation of bidirectional desire dynamics in humanai interaction our findings reveal that nearly half

performance ranging from to of baseline across specialized domains the system enables realtime embedding applications where subms latency is critical visionlanguage models vlms have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning however existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of highquality humanverified examples many current datasets rely on synthetically generated content by large language models llms furthermore most datasets are limited to english as manual quality assurance of translated samples is timeconsuming and costly to fill this gap we introduce pisabench a multilingual benchmark derived from english examples of the expertcreated pisa tests a unified framework for the assessment of student competencies in over eighty countries each example consists of humanextracted instructions questions answer options and images enriched with question type categories and has been translated from english into five additional languages spanish german chinese french and italian resulting in a fully parallel corpus covering six languages we evaluate stateoftheart visionlanguage models on pisabench and find that especially small models parameters fail to achieve high test scores we further find substantial performance degradation on nonenglish splits as well as high errorrates when models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning by releasing the dataset and evaluation framework we provide a resource for advancing research on multilingual multimodal reasoning graph neural networks operate through bottomup messagepassing fundamentally differing from human visual perception which intuitively captures global structures first we investigate the underappreciated potential of vision models for graph understanding finding they achieve performance comparable to gnns on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly different learning patterns these divergent behaviors combined with limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with topological understanding motivate our introduction of graphabstract this benchmark evaluates models ability to perceive global graph properties as humans do recognizing organizational archetypes detecting symmetry sensing connectivity strength and identifying critical elements our results reveal that vision models significantly outperform gnns on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph scales while gnns struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size this work demonstrates that vision models possess remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and scaleinvariant reasoning these findings open new avenues to leverage this underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition photorealistic codec avatars pca

leverage generative ai capabilities in both academic and professional contexts accurate diagnosis of alzheimers disease ad is essential for enabling timely intervention and slowing disease progression multimodal diagnostic approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information across behavioral and perceptual domains eyetracking and facial features in particular are important indicators of cognitive function reflecting attentional distribution and neurocognitive state however few studies have explored their joint integration for auxiliary ad diagnosis in this study we propose a multimodal crossenhanced fusion framework that synergistically leverages eyetracking and facial features for ad detection the framework incorporates two key modules a a crossenhanced fusion attention module cefam which models intermodal interactions through crossattention and global enhancement and a directionaware convolution module dacm which captures finegrained directional facial features via horizontalvertical receptive fields together these modules enable adaptive and discriminative multimodal representation learning to support this work we constructed a synchronized multimodal dataset including patients with ad and healthy controls hc by recording aligned facial video and eyetracking sequences during a visual memorysearch paradigm providing an ecologically valid resource for evaluating integration strategies extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods achieving a classification accuracy of in distinguishing ad from hc highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic performance by explicitly modeling intermodal dependencies and modalityspecific contributions large language models llms often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between their asserted confidence and actual problemsolving competence we offer a mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal states across two phases pregenerative assessment and solution execution a ple linear probe decodes the internal solvability belief of a model revealing a wellordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and across math code planning and logic tasks yet the geometries diverge although belief is linearly decodable the assessment manifold has high linear effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components while the subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lowerdimensional manifold this sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically explains the confidencecompetence gap causal interventions that steer representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control the constrained dynamics of execution we thus uncover a twosystem architecture a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically ple executor these results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are actionable levers instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural dynamics of execution rather than the highlevel geometry of assessment tractography fiber clustering using diffusion mri dmri is a crucial method for white matter wm parcellation to enable analysis of brains structural connectivity in health and disease current fiber clustering strategies primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics ie the spatial trajectories to group ilar fibers into clusters while neglecting the functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts there is increasing evidence that neural activity in the wm can be measured using functional mri fmri providing potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence furthermore microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy fa can be computed from dmri as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the clusters in this paper we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework namely deep multiview fiber clustering dmvfc which uses joint multimodal dmri and fmri data to enable functionally consistent wm parcellation dmvfc can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural characteristics of the wm fibers with the fmri bold signals along the fiber tracts dmvfc includes two major components a multiview pretraining module to compute embedding features from each source of information separately including fiber geometry microstructure measures and functional signals and a collaborative finetuning module to ultaneously refine the differences of embeddings in the experiments we compare dmvfc with two stateoftheart fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent wm parcellation results this work aims to train deep learning models to perform automatic target recognition atr on synthetic aperture radar sar images to circumvent the lack of real labelled measurements we resort to synthetic data produced by sar ulators ulation offers full control over the virtual environment which enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will however ulations are intrinsically grounded on plifying assumptions of the real world ie physical models thus synthetic datasets are not as representative as real measurements consequently atr models trained on synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements our contributions to this problem are twofold on one hand we demonstrate and quantify the impact of the ulation paradigm on the atr on the other hand we propose a new approach to tackle the atr problem combine two sar ulators that are grounded on different but complementary paradigms to produce synthetic datasets to this end we use two ulators mocem which is based on a scattering centers model approach and salsa which resorts on a ray tracing strategy we train atr models using synthetic dataset generated both by mocem and salsa and our deep learning approach called adasca we reach an accuracy of almost on the mstar measurements generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a challenging task for video captioning models existing approaches often struggle to capture finegrained motion details resulting in vague or semantically inconsistent captions in this work we introduce the motionaugmented caption model macm a novel generative framework that enhances caption quality by incorporating motionaware decoding at its core macm leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to explicitly highlight human body dynamics thereby reducing hallucinations and improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated captions to support research in this area we present the human motion insight hmi dataset comprising videodescription pairs

insights into factors contributing to gaps in healthcare outcomes to determine whether large language models llms can identify potential underlying factors and avenues for intervention we performed topicaware hierarchical summarization of narratives from african american aa storytellers fifty transcribed stories of aa experiences were used to identify topics in their experience using the latent dirichlet allocation lda technique stories about a given topic were summarized using an opensource llmbased hierarchical summarization approach topic summaries were generated by summarizing across story summaries for each story that addressed a given topic generated topic summaries were rated for fabrication accuracy comprehensiveness and usefulness by the gpt model and the models reliability was validated against the original story summaries by two domain experts topics were identified in the fifty aa stories the gpt ratings suggest that topic summaries were free from fabrication highly accurate comprehensive and useful the reliability of gpt ratings compared to expert assessments showed moderate to high agreement our approach identified aa experiencerelevant topics such as health behaviors interactions with medical team members caregiving and symptom management among others such insights could help researchers identify potential factors and interventions by learning from unstructured narratives in an efficient mannerleveraging the communicative power of storytelling the use of lda and llms to identify and summarize the experience of aa individuals suggests a variety of possible avenues for health research and possible clinical improvements to support patients and caregivers thereby ultimately improving health outcomes ensuring secure and efficient multiuser mu transmission is critical for vehicular communication systems chaosbased modulation schemes have garnered considerable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security however most existing mu

computationally expensive requiring hundreds or even thousands of function evaluations nfes to yield samples of acceptable quality which can become a bottleneck in practical design campaigns that often generate designs per target in image generation rectified flows reflow can significantly reduce the required nfes for a given target quality but their application in protein backbone generation has been less studied we apply reflow to improve the low nfe performance of pretrained se flow matching models for protein backbone generation and systematically study reflow design choices in the context of protein generation in data curation training and inference time settings in particular we show that reflow in the protein domain is particularly sensitive to the choice of coupling

this work presents a personalityaware multimodal framework that integrates eyetracking sequences big five personality traits and contextual stimulus cues to predict both perceived and felt emotions seventythree participants viewed speechcontaining clips from the cremad dataset while providing eyetracking signals personality assessments and emotion ratings our neural models captured temporal gaze dynamics and fused them with trait and stimulus information yielding consistent gains over svm and literature baselines results show that i stimulus cues strongly enhance perceivedemotion predictions macro up to while ii personality traits provide the largest improvements for felt emotion recognition macro up to these findings highlight the benefit of combining physiological traitlevel and contextual information to address the inherent subjectivity of emotion by distinguishing between perceived and felt responses our approach advances multimodal affective computing and points toward more personalized and ecologically valid emotionaware systems network embedding has been widely used in social recommendation and network analysis such as recommendation systems and anomaly detection with graphs however most of previous approaches cannot handle large graphs efficiently due to that i computation on graphs is often costly and ii the size of graph or the intermediate results of vectors could be prohibitively large rendering it difficult to be processed on a single machine in this paper we propose an efficient and effective distributed algorithm for network embedding on large graphs using apache spark which recursively partitions a graph into several smallsized subgraphs to capture the internal and external structural information of nodes and then computes the network embedding for each subgraph in parallel finally by aggregating the outputs on all subgraphs we obtain the embeddings of nodes in a linear cost after that we demonstrate in various experiments that our proposed approach is able to handle graphs with billions of edges within a few hours and is at least times faster than the stateoftheart approaches besides it achieves up to and improvements on link prediction and node classification tasks respectively in the end we deploy the proposed algorithms in two online games of tencent with the applications of friend recommendation and item recommendation which improve the competitors by up to in running time and up to in the corresponding evaluation metrics public research results on largescale supervised finetuning of ai agents remain relatively rare since the collection of agent training data presents unique challenges in this work we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of underlying data sources but that a large variety of data is fragmented across heterogeneous formats tools and interfaces to this end we introduce the agent data protocol adp a lightweight representation language that serves as an interlingua between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent training pipelines downstream the design of adp is expressive enough to capture a large variety of tasks including apitool use browsing coding software engineering and general agentic workflows while remaining ple to parse and train on without engineering at a perdataset level in experiments we unified a broad collection of existing agent training datasets into adp format and converted the standardized adp data into trainingready formats for multiple agent frameworks we performed sft on these data and demonstrated an average performance gain of over corresponding base models and delivers stateoftheart or nearsota performance on standard coding browsing tool use and research benchmarks without domainspecific tuning all code and data are released publicly in the hope that adp could help lower the barrier to standardized scalable and reproducible agent training we present tongyi deepresearch an agentic large language model which is specifically designed for longhorizon deep informationseeking research tasks to incentivize autonomous deep research agency tongyi deepresearch is developed through an endtoend training framework that combines agentic midtraining and agentic posttraining enabling scalable reasoning and information seeking across complex tasks we design a highly scalable data synthesis pipeline that is fully automatic without relying on costly human annotation and empowers all training stages by constructing customized environments for each stage our system enables stable and consistent interactions throughout tongyi deepresearch featuring billion total parameters with only billion activated per token achieves stateoftheart performance across a range of agentic deep research benchmarks including humanitys last exam browsecomp browsecompzh webwalkerqa xbenchdeepsearch frames and xbenchdeepsearch we opensource the model framework and complete solutions to empower the community reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf has emerged as a key technique for posttraining large language models despite its empirical success the theoretical understanding of rlhf is still limited as learning the klregularized target with only preference feedback poses additional challenges compared with canonical rl existing works mostly study the rewardbased bradleyterry bt preference model and extend classical designs utilizing optimism or pessimism this work instead considers the general preference model whose practical relevance has been observed recently and obtains performance guarantees with major orderwise improvements over existing ones surprisingly these results are derived from algorithms that directly use the empirical estimates ie greedy sampling as opposed to constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works this insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy class under the klregularized target and we further specialize it to the bt model highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in rlhf llmbased web agents show immense promise for information seeking yet their effectiveness on longhorizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental tradeoff in context management prevailing reactbased agents suffer from context saturation as they accumulate noisy raw histories while methods that fixedly summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical details addressing these we introduce agentfold a novel agent paradigm centered on proactive context management inspired by the human cognitive process of retrospective consolidation agentfold treats its context as a dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted rather than a passive log to be filled at each step it learns to execute a folding operation which manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales it can perform granular condensations to preserve vital finegrained details or deep consolidations to abstract away entire multistep subtasks the results on prominent benchmarks are striking with ple supervised finetuning without continual pretraining or rl our agentfoldbab agent achieves on browsecomp and on browsecompzh notably this performance not only surpasses or matches opensource models of a dramatically larger scale such as the deepseekvbab but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like openais omini parallel thinking expands exploration breadth complementing the deep exploration of informationseeking is agents to further enhance problemsolving capability however conventional parallel thinking faces two key challenges in this setting inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from scratch and difficulty in integrating longhorizon reasoning trajectories during answer generation as limited context capacity prevents full consideration of the reasoning process to address these issues we propose parallelmuse a twostage paradigm designed for deep is agents the first stage functionalityspecified partial rollout partitions generated sequences into functional regions and performs uncertaintyguided path reuse and branching to enhance exploration efficiency the second stage compressed reasoning aggregation exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final answer experiments across multiple opensource agents and benchmarks demonstrate up to performance improvement with a reduction in exploratory token consumption llmbased search agents are increasingly trained on entitycentric synthetic data to solve complex knowledgeintensive tasks however prevailing training methods like group relative policy optimization grpo discard this rich entity information relying instead on sparse outcomebased rewards this critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative nearmiss samplesthose with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answerfrom complete failures thus discarding valuable learning signals we address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of groundtruth entities identified during an agents reasoning process and final answer accuracy building on this insight we introduce entityaware group relative policy optimization egrpo a novel framework that formulates a dense entityaware reward function egrpo assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate enabling the model to effectively learn from these nearmisses experiments on diverse questionanswering qa and deep research benchmarks show that egrpo consistently and significantly outperforms the grpo baseline furthermore our analysis reveals that egrpo not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls demonstrating a more effective and sampleefficient approach to aligning search agents the inverse source problem arising in photoacoustic tomography and in several other coupledphysics modalities is frequently solved by iterative algorithms such algorithms are based on the minimization of a certain cost functional in addition novel deep learning techniques are currently being investigated to further improve such optimization approaches all such methods require multiple applications of the operator defining the forward problem and of its adjoint in this paper we present new asymptotically fast algorithms for numerical evaluation of the forward and adjoint operators applicable in the circular acquisition geometry for an times image our algorithms compute these operators in mathcalon log floating point operations we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in numerical ulations where they are used as an integral part of several iterative image reconstruction techniques classic variational methods such as nonnegative least squares and total variation regularized least squares as well as deep learning methods such as learned primal dual a python implementation of our algorithms and computational examples is available to the general public large language models llms have gained significant traction in medical decision support systems particularly in the context of medical question answering and roleplaying ulations a common practice promptbased role playing pbrp instructs models to adopt different clinical roles eg medical students residents attending physicians to ulate varied professional behaviors however the impact of such role prompts on model reasoning capabilities remains unclear this study introduces the rpneuronactivated evaluation frameworkrpna to evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct rolespecific cognitive processes in llms or merely modify linguistic style we test this framework on three medical qa datasets employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to assess changes in reasoning pathways our results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the medical reasoning abilities of llms instead they primarily affect surfacelevel linguistic features with no evidence of distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation across clinical roles despite superficial stylistic changes the core decisionmaking mechanisms of llms remain uniform across roles indicating that current pbrp methods fail to replicate the cognitive complexity found in realworld medical practice this highlights the limitations of roleplaying in medical ai and asizes the need for models that ulate genuine cognitive processes rather than linguistic have released the related code in the following repository githubcomiaarshanghairoleplayllmdoctor out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous driving only few make use of the options or skills framework that is surprising as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control applications in general and autonomous driving tasks in specific therefore in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous driving tasks on highways more specifically we define dedicated options for longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort constraints this way prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more easily we propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and derive practical algorithms following stateoftheart reinforcement learning techniques by separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral control the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have while being easier to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions of all the investigated approaches these flexible policies over hybrid options perform the best under varying traffic conditions outperforming the baseline policies over actions with the increasing integration of intelligent driving functions into serialproduced vehicles ensuring their functionality and robustness poses greater challenges compared to traditional road testing scenariobased virtual testing offers significant advantages in terms of time and cost efficiency reproducibility and exploration of edge cases we propose a transformerenhanced conditional variational autoencoder cvaet model for generating multiagent traffic scenarios in roundabouts which are characterized by high vehicle dynamics and complex layouts yet remain relatively underexplored in current research the results show that the proposed model can accurately reconstruct original scenarios and generate realistic diverse synthetic scenarios besides two keyperformanceindicators kpis are employed to evaluate the interactive behavior in the generated scenarios analysis of the latent space reveals partial disentanglement with several latent dimensions exhibiting distinct and interpretable effects on scenario attributes such as vehicle entry timing exit timing and velocity profiles the results demonstrate the models capability to generate scenarios for the validation of intelligent driving functions involving multiagent interactions as well as to augment data for their development and iterative improvement language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and information retrieval however these search agents assume user queries are complete and unambiguous an assumption that diverges from reality where users begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction yet most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process and existing benchmarks cannot assess this capability to address this gap we introduce interactcomp a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search following the principle of easy to verify interact to disambiguate we construct expertcurated questions across domains through a targetdistractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only through interaction evaluation of models reveals striking failure the best model achieves only accuracy despite with complete context exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits forced interaction produces dramatic gains demonstrating latent capability current strategies fail to engage longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities stagnated over months while search performance improved sevenfold revealing a critical blind spot this stagnation coupled with the immediate feedback inherent to search tasks makes interactcomp a valuable resource for both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents the code is available at we study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for relu networks the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset with epsilonseparation between differently labeled points while ensuring predictions remain consistent within a muball around each training sample we establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the robustness ratio rho mu epsilon unlike prior work we provide a finegrained analysis across the entire range rho in and obtain tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results our findings reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of nonrobust memorization when rho is small but grows with increasing rho predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for understanding complex phenomena in physiology brain connectivity climate dynamics and socioeconomic behaviour causal discovery in time series is hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal relationships especially as the number of variables and time points grow a common approach to plify the task is the socalled orderingbased methods traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of the resulting model in this work we fix this issue by leveraging multiple valid causal orderings instead of a single one as standard practice we propose dots diffusion ordered temporal structure using diffusionbased causal discovery for temporal data by integrating multiple orderings dots effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic graph mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in singleordering approaches we formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the additive noise model and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to enable efficient hessian estimation extensive experiments validate the approach empirical evaluations on synthetic and realworld datasets demonstrate that dots outperforms stateoftheart baselines offering a scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery on synthetic benchmarks variables samples dots improves mean windowgraph from best baseline to on the causaltime realworld benchmark while baselines remain the best on individual datasets dots attains the highest average summarygraph while halving runtime relative to graphoptimisation methods these results establish dots as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery spiking neural networks snns are one of the most promising bioinspired neural networks models and have drawn increasing attention in recent years the eventdriven communication mechanism of snns allows for sparse and theoretically lowpower operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware however the binary nature of instantaneous spikes also leads to considerable information loss in snns resulting in accuracy degradation to address this issue we propose a multilevel spiking neuron model able to provide both lowquantization error and minimal inference latency while approaching the performance of full precision artificial neural networks anns experimental results with popular network architectures and datasets show that multilevel spiking neurons provide better information compression allowing therefore a reduction in latency without performance loss when compared to binary snns on image classification scenarios multilevel snns indeed allow reducing by to times the energy consumption depending on the number of quantization intervals on neuromorphic data our approach allows us to drastically reduce the inference latency to timestep which corresponds to a compression factor of compared to previously published results at the architectural level we propose a new residual architecture that we call sparseresnet through a careful analysis of the spikes propagation in residual connections we highlight a spike avalanche effect that affects most spiking residual architectures using our sparseresnet architecture we can provide stateoftheart accuracy results in image classification while reducing by more than the network activity compared to the previous spiking resnets with the release of new large language models llms like llama and mistral zeroshot crosslingual transfer has become increasingly feasible due to their multilingual pretraining and strong generalization capabilities however adapting these decoderonly llms to new tasks across languages remains challenging while parameterefficient finetuning peft techniques like lowrank adaptation lora are widely used prefixbased techniques such as soft prompt tuning prefix tuning and llama adapter are less explored especially for zeroshot transfer in decoderonly models we present a comprehensive study of three prefixbased methods for zeroshot crosslingual transfer from english to high and lowresource languages our analysis further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts as well as the impact of scaling model sizes from to with llama prefix methods outperform lorabaselines by up to on the belebele benchmark ilar improvements were observed with mistral as well despite using only learning parameters with prefix tuning we achieve consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks these findings highlight the potential of prefixbased techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to lora particularly in lowresource multilingual settings training timeseries forecast models requires aligning the conditional distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence the standard direct forecast df approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative loglikelihood of the label sequence typically estimated using the mean squared error however this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of label autocorrelation in this paper we propose distdf which achieves alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional forecast and label distributions because conditional discrepancies are difficult to estimate from finite timeseries observations we introduce a newly proposed jointdistribution wasserstein discrepancy for timeseries forecasting which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of interest this discrepancy admits tractable differentiable estimation from empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradientbased training extensive experiments show that distdf improves the performance diverse forecast models and achieves the stateoftheart forecasting performance code is available at with the widespread adoption of llms lora has become a dominant method for peft and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention however existing methods have notable limitations many methods do not incorporate targetdomain data while gradientbased methods exploit data only at a shallow level by relying on onestep gradient decomposition which remains unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the onestep finetuning model that serves as their basis as well as the fact that these methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on restrictive isotropic assumptions in this paper we establish a theoretical framework for dataaware lora initialization based on asymptotic analysis starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation of the parameter discrepancy between the finetuned and target models we derive an optimization problem with two components a bias term which is related to the parameter distance between the finetuned and target models and is imated using a fishergradient formulation to preserve anisotropy and a variance term which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling stochasticity through the fisher information by solving this problem we obtain an optimal initialization strategy for lora building on this theoretical framework we develop an efficient algorithm lorada which estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target domain samples and obtains the optimal lora initialization empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that lorada consistently improves final accuracy over existing initialization methods additional studies show faster more stable convergence robustness across ranks and only a small initialization overhead for lorada the source code will be released upon publication quantum networks rely on both quantum and classical channels for coordinated operation current architectures employ entanglement distribution and key exchange over quantum channels but often assume that classical communication is sufficiently secure in practice classical channels protected by traditional cryptography remain vulnerable to quantum adversaries since largescale quantum computers could break widely used publickey schemes and reduce the effective security of symmetric cryptography this perspective presents a quantumresistant network architecture that secures classical communication with postquantum cryptographic techniques while supporting entanglementbased communication over quantum channels beyond cryptographic protection the framework incorporates continuous monitoring of both quantum and classical layers together with orchestration across heterogeneous infrastructures to ensure endtoend security collectively these mechanisms provide a pathway toward scalable robust and secure quantum networks that remain dependable against both classical and quantumera threats in the context of federated learning with heterogeneous data environments local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local training steps deviating from the overall data distributions aggregation of these local updates eg with fedavg often does not align with the global model optimum client drift resulting in an update that is suboptimal for most clients personalized federated learning approaches address this challenge by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients models on their own data distribution generalization to outofdistribution samples which is a substantial benefit of fedavg and represents a significant component of robustness appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and evaluation processes this study involves a thorough evaluation of federated learning approaches encompassing both their local performance and their generalization capabilities therefore we examine different stages within a single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the considered metrics furthermore we propose and incorporate a modified approach of fedavg designated as federated learning with individualized updates fliu extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an adaptive personalization factor we evaluate and compare the approaches empirically using mnist and cifar under various distributional conditions including benchmark iid and pathological noniid as well as additional novel test environments with dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity as machine learning ml models become increasingly deployed through cloud infrastructures the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a significant security challenge homomorphic encryption he has emerged as a compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs however the integration of he within large scale cloud native pipelines remains constrained by high computational overhead orchestration complexity and model compatibility issues this paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacypreserving ml inference the proposed architecture integrates containerized he modules with kubernetesbased orchestration enabling elastic scaling and parallel encrypted computation across distributed environments furthermore optimization strategies including ciphertext packing polynomial modulus adjustment and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to times inference acceleration and reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional he pipelines these findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying secure mlasaservice mlaas systems that guarantee data confidentiality under zerotrust cloud conditions fixed beamforming is widely used in practice since it does not depend on the estimation of noise statistics and provides relatively stable performance however a single beamformer cannot adapt to varying acoustic conditions which limits its interference suppression capability to address this adaptive convex combination acc algorithms have been introduced where the outputs of multiple fixed beamformers are linearly combined to improve robustness nevertheless acc often fails in highly nonstationary scenarios such as rapidly moving interference since its adaptive updates cannot reliably track rapid changes to overcome this limitation we propose a frameonline neural fusion framework for multiple distortionless differential beamformers which estimates the combination weights through a neural network compared with conventional acc the proposed method adapts more effectively to dynamic acoustic environments achieving stronger interference suppression while maintaining the distortionless constraint with the development of artificial intelligence ai techniques implementing aibased techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging research topic within this context aibased channel characterization and estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver efficiency in largescale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ofdm systems specifically by formulating channel estimation as a generative ai problem generative ai methods such as diffusion models dms can efficiently deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with traditional signal processing methods this paper focuses on the transceiver design of ofdm systems based on dms provides an illustration of the potential of dms in wireless transceivers and points out the related research directions brought by dms we also provide a proofofconcept case study of further adapting dms for better wireless receiver performance as large language models llms become increasingly integrated into our lives their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern detecting and evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit rather than explicit in nature so developing evaluation methods that assess the implicit knowledge representations of llms is essential we present a novel word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in llms based on ulating semantic priming within llmgenerated word association networks our promptbased approach taps into the implicit relational structures encoded in llms providing both quantitative and qualitative assessments of bias unlike most promptbased evaluation methods our method enables direct comparisons between various llms and humans providing a valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of llms with human cognition to demonstrate the utility of our methodology we apply it to both humans and several widely used llms to investigate social biases related to gender religion ethnicity sexual orientation and political party our results reveal both convergences and divergences between llm and human biases providing new perspectives on the potential risks of using llms our methodology contributes to a systematic scalable and generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple llms and humans advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible language technologies reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discretetime dynamics even though the underlying realworld control systems are often continuous in time in this paper we study the problem of continuoustime reinforcement learning where the unknown system dynamics are represented using nonlinear ordinary differential equations odes we leverage probabilistic models such as gaussian processes and bayesian neural networks to learn an uncertaintyaware model of the underlying ode our algorithm combrl greedily maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic uncertainty this yields a scalable and sampleefficient approach to continuoustime modelbased rl we show that combrl achieves sublinear regret in the rewarddriven setting and in the unsupervised rl setting ie without extrinsic rewards we provide a sample complexity bound in our experiments we evaluate combrl in both standard and unsupervised rl settings and demonstrate that it scales better is more sampleefficient than prior methods and outperforms baselines across several deep rl tasks hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of large language models llms particularly in realworld applications among various mitigation strategies retrievalaugmented generation rag and reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely adopted approaches marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to balancing creativity and reliability however their synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been systematically examined this survey adopts an applicationoriented perspective of capability enhancement to analyze how rag reasoning enhancement and their integration in agentic systems mitigate hallucinations we propose a taxonomy distinguishing knowledgebased and logicbased hallucinations systematically examine how rag and reasoning address each and present a unified framework supported by realworld applications evaluations and benchmarks personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent text but also to align with a target users style tone and topical focus existing retrievalaugmented approaches such as lamp and pgraphrag enrich profiles with user and neighbor histories but they stop at generation and often yield outputs that drift in tone topic or style we present perfine a unified trainingfree critiquerefine framework that enhances personalization through iterative profilegrounded feedback in each iteration an llm generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile and a critic llm also conditioned on the same profile provides structured feedback on tone vocabulary sentence structure and topicality the generator then revises while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across iterations we further study additional inferencetime strategies such as bestofn and topic extraction to balance quality and efficiency across yelp goodreads and amazon datasets perfine consistently improves personalization over pgraphrag with geval gains of steady improvements over refinement iterations and scalability with increasing critic size these results highlight that posthoc profileaware feedback offers a powerful paradigm for personalized llm generation that is both trainingfree and modelagnostic while new benchmarks for large language models llms are being developed continuously to catch up with the growing capabilities of new models and ai in general using and evaluating llms in nonenglish languages remains a littlecharted landscape we give a concise overview of recent developments in llm benchmarking and then propose a new taxonomy for the categorization of benchmarks that is tailored to multilingual or nonenglish use scenarios we further propose a set of best practices and quality standards that could lead to a more coordinated development of benchmarks for european languages among other recommendations we advocate for a higher language and culture sensitivity of evaluation methods large language models llms have demonstrated that largescale pretraining enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the language domain this success however has not translated as effectively to the visual domain where models including llms continue to struggle with compositional understanding sample efficiency and generalpurpose problemsolving we investigate video diffusion models vdms as a promising direction for bridging this gap pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics which we hypothesize can support broad task adaptability to test this we design a controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained llm and a pretrained vdm are equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural modalities across benchmarks including arcagi conceptarc visual games route planning and cellular automata vdms demonstrate higher data efficiency than their language counterparts taken together our results indicate that video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual foundation models large language models are increasingly used for islamic guidance but risk

tone depth originality gpto scored highest in islamic accuracy and citation ansari ai followed and fanar lagged despite relatively strong performance models still fall short in reliably producing accurate islamic content and citations a paramount requirement in faithsensitive writing gpto had the highest mean quantitative score while ansari ai led qualitative pairwise wins fanar though trailing introduces innovations for islamic and arabic contexts this study underscores the need for communitydriven benchmarks centering muslim perspectives offering an early step toward more reliable ai in islamic knowledge and other highstakes domains such as medicine law and journalism the recent success of large language models llms has renewed interest in whether recommender systems can achieve ilar scaling benefits conventional recommenders dominated by massive embedding tables tend to plateau as embedding dimensions grow in contrast the emerging generative paradigm replaces embeddings with compact semantic id sid sequences produced by autoregressive transformers yet most industrial deployments remain proprietary leaving two fundamental questions open do the expected scaling laws hold on public benchmarks what is the minimal posttraining recipe that enables competitive performance we present minionerec to the best of our knowledge the first fully opensource generative recommendation framework which provides an endtoend workflow spanning sid construction supervised finetuning and recommendationoriented reinforcement learning we generate sids via a residual quantized vae and posttrain qwen backbones ranging from to parameters on the amazon review dataset our experiments reveal a consistent downward trend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size validating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach to further enhance performance we propose a lightweight yet effective posttraining pipeline that enforces fullprocess sid alignment and applies reinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards together these techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and candidate diversity retrievalaugmented generation rag struggles on long structured financial filings where relevant evidence is sparse and crossreferenced this paper presents a systematic investigation of advanced metadatadriven retrievalaugmented generation rag techniques proposing and evaluating a novel multistage rag architecture that leverages llmgenerated metadata we introduce a sophisticated indexing pipeline to create contextually rich document chunks and benchmark a spectrum of enhancements including preretrieval filtering postretrieval reranking and enriched embeddings benchmarked on the financebench dataset our results reveal that while a powerful reranker is essential for precision the most significant performance gains come from embedding chunk metadata directly with text contextual chunks our proposed optimal architecture combines llmdriven preretrieval optimizations with these contextual embeddings to achieve superior performance additionally we present a custom metadata reranker that offers a compelling costeffective alternative to commercial solutions highlighting a practical tradeoff between peak performance and operational efficiency this study provides a blueprint for building robust metadataaware rag systems for financial document analysis we introduce perception learning pel a paradigm that optimizes an agents sensory interface fphimathcalxtomathcalz using taskagnostic signals decoupled from downstream decision learning gthetamathcalztomathcaly pel directly targets labelfree perceptual properties such as stability to nuisances informativeness without collapse and controlled geometry assessed via objective representationinvariant metrics we formalize the separation of perception and decision define perceptual properties independent of objectives or reparameterizations and prove that pel updates preserving sufficient invariants are orthogonal to bayes taskrisk gradients additionally we provide a suite of taskagnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual quality generating long informative and factual outputs remains a major challenge for large language models llms existing benchmarks for longform generation typically assess realworld queries with hardtoverify metrics or use synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook realworld intricacies in this paper we introduce longweave which balances realworld and verifiable assessment with constraintverifier evaluation coveval coveval constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within realworld scenarios then systematically generating corresponding queries textual materials and constraints based on these targets this ensures that tasks are both realistic and objectively assessable enabling rigorous assessment of model capabilities in meeting complex realworld constraints longweave supports customizable inputoutput lengths up to kk tokens across seven distinct tasks evaluation on llms shows that even stateoftheart models encounter significant challenges in longform generation as realworld complexity and output length increase large language models llms are increasingly used to answer everyday questions yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content remains uneven across languages we propose a comprehensive method that i translates modern standard arabic msa multiplechoice questions mcqs into english and several arabic dialects ii converts them into openended questions oeqs iii benchmarks a range of zeroshot and finetuned llms under both mcq and oeq settings and iv generates chainofthought cot rationales to finetune models for stepbystep reasoning using this method we extend an existing dataset in which qas are parallelly aligned across multiple language varieties making it to our knowledge the first of its kind we conduct extensive experiments with both open and closed models our findings show that i models underperform on arabic dialects revealing persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialectspecific knowledge ii arabiccentric models perform well on mcqs but struggle with oeqs and iii cot improves judged correctness while yielding mixed ngrambased metrics the developed dataset will be publicly released to support further research on culturally and linguistically inclusive evaluation remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene classification however their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and sensor domains while recent visionlanguage models like clip have shown promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual and textual modalities their direct application to remote sensing remains suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for taskspecific semantic adaptation to address this critical challenge we systematically explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for fewshot remote sensing image scene classification we evaluate several representative methods including context optimization conditional context optimization multimodal prompt learning and prompting with selfregulating constraints these approaches reflect complementary design philosophies from static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization multimodal prompts for joint visionlanguage adaptation and semantically regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting we benchmark these promptlearning methods against two standard baselines zeroshot clip with handcrafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen clip features through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets including crossdataset generalization tests we demonstrate that prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in fewshot scenarios notably prompting with selfregulating constraints achieves the most robust crossdomain performance our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery providing a strong foundation for future research in this field training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model outputs is a promising way to improve llms for complex reasoning tasks however existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for annotating critique data to address this we propose critiquerl an online rl approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger supervision our approach operates on a twoplayer paradigm the actor generates a response the critic provides feedback and the actor refines the response accordingly we first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward signals from the actors outputs for rl optimization often leads to unsatisfactory critics while their helpfulness ie providing constructive feedback improves the discriminability ie determining whether a response is highquality or not remains poor resulting in marginal performance gains to overcome this critiquerl adopts a twostage optimization strategy in stage i it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct rulebased reward signals in stage ii it introduces indirect rewards based on actor refinement to improve the critics helpfulness while maintaining its discriminability via appropriate regularization extensive experiments across various tasks and models show that critiquerl delivers substantial performance improvements for example it achieves a gain on indomain tasks and a gain on outofdomain tasks for qwenb highlighting its potential bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding at scale furthermore realworld datasets often contain missing values and ple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty resulting in suboptimal results we present clusterpfn a transformerbased model that extends priordata fitted networks pfns to unsupervised bayesian clustering trained entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite gaussian mixture model gmm prior clusterpfn learns to estimate the posterior distribution over both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments our method estimates the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection procedures such as aic bic and variational inference vi and achieves clustering quality competitive with vi while being orders of magnitude faster clusterpfn can be trained on complex priors that include missing data outperforming

then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate sources the image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis closest to the original image in a proper feature space we also introduce a new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from commercial and opensource texttoimage generators the dataset provides a challenging attribution framework useful for developing new attribution models and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures the dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare them to fewshot methods results from stateoftheart fewshot approaches and other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing techniques when only a few samples are available for training or finetuning the experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future fewshot and

understanding sentiment analysis and content moderation with the emergence of multimodal large language models sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires integrating cues from audio and vision we present musag the first german multimodal sarcasm detection dataset consisting of minutes of manually selected and humanannotated statements from german television shows each instance provides aligned text audio and video modalities annotated separately by humans enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings we benchmark nine opensource and commercial models spanning text audio vision and multimodal architectures and compare their performance to human annotations our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in conversational settings models perform best on text this highlights a gap in current multimodal models and motivates the use of musag for developing models better suited to realistic scenarios we release musag publicly to support future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and humanmodel alignment matrix preconditioning is a critical technique to accelerate the solution of linear systems where performance heavily depends on the selection of preconditioning parameters traditional parameter selection approaches often define fixed constants for specific scenarios however they rely on domain expertise and fail to consider the instancewise

across various benchmarks stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and evolution of stars however estimating stellar masses in starforming regions is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions are highly inhomogeneous making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass but it requires large highquality labeled datasets from highresolution magnetohydrodynamical mhd ulations which are computationally expensive we address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic fractal images using the selfsupervised framework dinov and then applying the frozen model to limited highresolution mhd ulations our results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozenfeature regression stellar mass predictions with the pretrained model performing slightly better than a supervised model trained on the same limited ulations principal component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically meaningful structures suggesting that the model enables unsupervised segmentation of starforming regions without the need for

review are also explained the findings have significant implications for policy development and the transparency of data collection for smart devices lowbit floatingpoint fp formats such as fp provide significant acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware support on modern gpus and npus however we analyze that fp quantization offers speedup primarily for largedimensional matrix multiplications while inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to lowrank adaptation lora which uses smalldimensional matrices for efficient finetuning of large language models llms to address this limitation we propose falqon a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead from separate lora computational paths by directly merging lora adapters into an fpquantized backbone during finetuning furthermore we reformulate the forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce quantization overhead and introduce a rowwise proxy update mechanism that efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone experimental evaluations demonstrate that falqon achieves imately a times training speedup

sympatheticarousal representations into student encoders on wesad our method achieves strong stressdetection performance showing that representations of privileged eda can be transferred to lowcost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing hardware cost recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of highquality realworld driving datasets have propelled endtoend autonomous driving despite this progress relying solely on realworld data limits the variety of driving scenarios for training synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data however its application within ee ad models remains largely unexplored this is primarily due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor inputs such as camera or lidar typically provided in realworld scenarios to address this gap we introduce synad the first framework designed to enhance realworld ee ad models using synthetic data our method designates the agent with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a multiagent synthetic scenario we further project pathlevel scenarios onto maps and employ a newly developed maptobev network to derive birdseyeview features without relying on sensor inputs finally we devise a training strategy that effectively integrates these mapbased synthetic data with real driving data experimental results demonstrate that synad effectively integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance by bridging synthetic scenario generation and ee ad synad paves the way for more comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models accurate and longterm spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing while deep learning models as powerful parametric imators have shown remarkable success they suffer from a critical limitation the accumulation of errors during longterm autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible artifacts this deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature which struggles to capture the full constraints of a systems intrinsic dynamics to address this we introduce a novel retrievalaugmented prediction rap framework a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data the core philosophy of rap is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a nonparametric estimate of the systems local dynamics for any given state rap efficiently retrieves the most ilar historical analog from a largescale database the true future evolution of this analog then serves as a reference target critically this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dualstream architecture it provides strong dynamic guidance steering the models predictions towards physically viable trajectories in extensive benchmarks across meteorology turbulence and fire ulation rap not only surpasses stateoftheart methods but also significantly outperforms a strong analogonly forecasting baseline more importantly rap generates predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error divergence in longterm rollouts the utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to largescale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or regulatory hurdles while existing data generation methods particularly those based on generative adversarial networks gans have shown promise they frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship maintaining data utility and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise deployment we introduce cagan a novel generative framework specifically engineered to address these challenges for realworld tabular datasets cagan utilizes a twostep approach causal graph extraction to learn a robust comprehensive causal relationship in the datas manifold followed by a custom conditional wgangp wasserstein gan with gradient penalty that operates exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph more importantly the generator is trained with a new reinforcement learningbased objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases we demonstrate cagan superiority over six sota methods across tabular datasets our evaluations focused on core data engineering metrics causal preservation utility preservation and privacy preservation our method offers a practical highperformance solution for data engineers seeking to create highquality privacycompliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database systems accelerate software development and facilitate secure datadriven research selfsupervised learning ssl for combinatorial optimization co is an emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks in this paper we address a central challenge of ssl for co solving problems with discrete constraints we design an endtoend differentiable framework that enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural networks concretely we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on convex geometry and carathodorys theorem to decompose neural network outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to feasible sets this decompositionbased approach enables selfsupervised training but also ensures efficient qualitypreserving rounding of the neural net output into feasible solutions extensive experiments in cardinalityconstrained optimization show that our approach can consistently outperform neural baselines we further provide workedout examples of how our method can be applied beyond cardinalityconstrained problems to a diverse set of combinatorial optimization tasks including finding independent sets in graphs and solving matroidconstrained problems convolutional neural networks cnns has revolutionized computer vision but training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient problem this paper explores residual networks resnet introduced by he et al which overcomes this limitation by using skip connections resnet enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers in our implementation on the cifar dataset resnet achieves accuracy compared to for a traditional deep cnn of ilar depth while also converging faster and training more stably boundary vector cells bvcs are a class of neurons in the brains of vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and allocentric directions playing a central role in forming place fields in the hippocampus most computational bvc models are restricted to twodimensional environments making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment to address this limitation we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the bvc framework thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologicallyinspired robot model the proposed model processes lidar data to capture vertical contours thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely representation experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation the proposed model matches the performance of a baseline yet as complexity increases it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing these findings show that adding a vertical dimension to bvcbased localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in realworld spaces while retaining performance parity in pler nearplanar scenarios spatiotemporal multivariate time series forecast stmf uses the time series of spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast their values in a period of near future it has important applications in spatiotemporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air pollution prediction recent papers have addressed a practical problem of missing variables in the model input which arises in the sensing applications where the number of sensors is far less than the number of locations to be monitored due to budget constraints we observe that the state of the art assumes that the variables ie locations with sensors in the model input are predetermined and the important problem of how to choose the variables in the input has never been studied this paper fills the gap by studying a new problem of stmf with chosen variables which optimally selects moutofn variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast accuracy we propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model efficiency it consists of three novel technical components masked variableparameter pruning which progressively prunes less informative variables and attention parameters through quantilebased masking prioritized variableparameter replay which replays lowloss past samples to preserve learned knowledge for model stability dynamic extrapolation mechanism which propagates information from variables selected for the input to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency information experiments on five realworld datasets show that our work significantly outperforms the stateoftheart baselines in both accuracy and efficiency demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and model optimization understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis of neurological diseases existing methods often have difficulty in capturing the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific functional communities to this end this paper proposes a new pathlevel trajectory modeling framework neuropathnet to characterize the dynamic behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions based on medically supported static partitioning schemes such as yeo and smith ica we extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional partitions and model them using a temporal neural network we validate the model performance on three public functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri datasets and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods in multiple indicators this study can promote the development of dynamic graph learning methods for brain network analysis and provide possible clinical applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases knowledge distillation kd has become a cornerstone technique for compressing large language models llms into smaller more efficient student models however conventional kd approaches typically apply the distillation loss uniformly across all tokens regardless of the teachers confidence this indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise as the student is forced to learn from the teachers uncertain or highentropy predictions which may ultimately harm student performanceespecially when the teacher is much larger and more powerful to address this we propose speculative knowledge distillation speckd a novel plugandplay framework that introduces a dynamic tokenlevel gating mechanism inspired by the proposeandverify paradigm of speculative decoding at each step the students token proposal is verified against the teachers distribution the distillation loss is selectively applied only to accepted tokens while rejected tokens are masked out extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that speckd consistently and significantly outperforms strong kd baselines leading to more stable training and more capable student models and achieving stateoftheart results mitigating hallucinations in large language models llms is critical for their reliable deployment existing methods typically finetune llms to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope however these methods often rely on coarsegrained signals to guide llms to abstain such as overall confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers which may result in an imprecise awareness of the models own knowledge boundaries to this end we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on underlinefinegrained underlinesemantic underlineconfidence underlinereward ours which guides llms to abstain via samplespecific confidence specifically our method operates by sampling multiple candidate answers and conducting semantic clustering then training the llm to retain answers within highconfidence clusters and discard those within lowconfidence ones thereby promoting accurate posthoc abstention additionally we propose a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention finetuning tasks more comprehensively our method significantly enhances reliability in both indomain and outofdistribution benchmarks recent progress in large language models llms has advanced automatic code generation yet most approaches rely on direct singlestep translation from problem descriptions to code disregarding structured software engineering practices we introduce a lifecycleaware framework that systematically incorporates intermediate artifacts such as requirements analysis state machine modeling and pseudocode into both the training and inference stages this design aligns code generation with standard software development phases and enables more structured reasoning experiments show that lifecyclelevel finetuning improves code correctness by up to over the same model before finetuning with performance gains compounding across intermediate stages multistep inference consistently surpasses singlestep generation demonstrating the effectiveness of intermediate scaffolding notably opensource llms once finetuned under our framework match or slightly outperform models pretrained on code when applied to deepseekcoderb our framework yields relative codebleu improvements of and over chatgpt chatgptomini deepseekr and llamab respectively our pipeline also proves robust with up to less training data confirming its resilience ablation studies further reveal that each intermediate artifact contributes distinctly to final code quality with state machine modeling yielding the most substantial impact our source code and detailed experimental data are available at texttoimage models have recently made significant advances in generating realistic and semantically coherent images driven by advanced diffusion models and largescale webcrawled datasets however these datasets often contain inappropriate or biased content raising concerns about the generation of harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts we propose safe text embedding guidance stg a trainingfree approach to improve the safety of diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling stg adjusts the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final denoised image allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional training theoretically we show that stg aligns the underlying model distribution with safety constraints thereby achieving safer outputs while minimally affecting generation quality experiments on various safety scenarios including nudity violence and artiststyle removal show that stg consistently outperforms both trainingbased and trainingfree baselines in removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input prompts our code is available at foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains by leveraging largescale pretraining on unlabeled data demonstrating strong generalization to a variety of downstream tasks while such models have gained significant attention in fields like earth observation their application to mars science remains limited a key enabler of progress in other domains has been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic evaluation in contrast mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized evaluation frameworks which have limited progress toward developing foundation models for martian tasks to address this gap we introduce marsbench the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range of marsrelated tasks using both orbital and surface imagery marsbench comprises datasets spanning classification segmentation and object detection focused on key geologic features such as craters cones boulders and frost we provide standardized readytouse datasets and baseline evaluations using models pretrained on natural images earth satellite data and stateoftheart visionlanguage models results from all analyses suggest that marsspecific foundation models may offer advantages over generaldomain counterparts motivating further exploration of domainadapted pretraining marsbench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and comparing machine learning models for mars science our data models and code are available at operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific fields and engineering applications yet numerical methods are hindered by the curse of dimensionality recent deep learning methods provide an efficient approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks these methods performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the given operator larger gaps between the operators eigenvalues will improve precision thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral distribution can enhance their performance based on this observation we propose the spectral transformation network stnet during each iteration stnet uses imate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral transformations on the original operator turning it into an equivalent but easier problem specifically we employ deflation projection to exclude the subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions thereby reducing the search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions additionally our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses those outside further improving performance extensive experiments demonstrate that stnet consistently outperforms existing learningbased methods achieving stateoftheart performance in accuracy we present a

most accurate learning methodologies we have tested on the same target gpu platform hdgc is on average and times faster than gcnii a graph neural network implementation and hdgl a hyperdimensional computing implementation respectively as the majority of the learning operates on binary vectors we expect outstanding energy performance of hdgc on neuromorphic and emerging processinmemory devices texttoimage diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pretrained text encoder but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps limiting their adaptability to the generative process we propose diffusion adaptive text embedding date which dynamically updates text embeddings at each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data we formulate an optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean predicted image and the text this allows date to dynamically adapts the text conditions to the reversediffused images throughout diffusion sampling without requiring additional model training through theoretical analysis and empirical results we show that date maintains the generative capability of the model while providing superior textimage alignment over fixed text embeddings across various tasks including multiconcept generation and textguided image editing our code is available at the proliferation of probabilistic ai has promoted proposals for specialized stochastic computers despite promising efficiency gains these proposals have failed to gain traction because they rely on fundamentally limited modeling techniques and exotic unscalable hardware in this work we address these shortcomings by proposing an alltransistor probabilistic computer that implements powerful denoising models at the hardware level a systemlevel analysis indicates that devices based on our architecture could achieve performance parity with gpus on a ple image benchmark using imately times less energy with the rapid proliferation of digital media the need for efficient and transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever traditional image guardrail models constrained by predefined categories often misclassify content due to their pure featurebased learning without semantic reasoning moreover these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats requiring costly retraining for new threats to address these limitations we introduce safevision a novel image guardrail that integrates humanlike reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency our approach incorporates an effective data collection and generation framework a policyfollowing training pipeline and a customized loss function we also propose a diverse qa generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness safevision dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time eliminating the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and explanations recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks which either lack granularity or cover limited risks we introduce visionharm a highquality dataset comprising two subsets visionharm thirdparty visionharmt and visionharm comprehensivevisionharmc spanning diverse harmful categories through extensive experiments we show that safevision achieves stateoftheart performance on different benchmarks safevision outperforms gpto by on visionharmt and by on visionharmc while being over faster safevision sets a comprehensive policyfollowing and explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling especially over the last few years however some challenges remain one of them is precise and iterative object editing in many of the current methods trying to edit the generated image for example changing the color of a particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other elements unchanged by changing the conditioning signals often leads to unintended global changes in the scene in this work we take the first steps to address the above challenges taking inspiration from the universal scene descriptor usd standard developed in the computer graphics community we introduce the neural universal scene descriptor or neural usd in this framework we represent scenes and objects in a structured hierarchical manner this accommodates diverse signals minimizes modelspecific constraints and enables perobject control over appearance geometry and pose we further apply a finetuning approach which ensures that the above control signals are disentangled from one another we evaluate several design considerations for our framework demonstrating how neural usd enables iterative and incremental workflows more information at there have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase multilingual knowledge using only english data is insufficient for multilingual llms however their analyses remain highly performanceoriented in this paper we switch the point of view to evaluation and address an additional blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual llm is fully finetuned with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning here language confusion occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input prompt language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning causing the standard referencebased metrics to fail we tackle this phenomenon in three steps introduce ngrambased languagemix nmix score to quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in multilingual llms demonstrate that referencebased metrics result in false negatives when nmix score is high and suggest the need of new type of unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated sentences we call this type of metrics as semanticbased metric chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning modeling and abstraction capabilities of large language models llms as it has welldefined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide spectrum of skill levels however existing evaluations of llm ability in chess are ad hoc and narrow in scope making it difficult to accurately measure llm chess understanding and how it varies with scale posttraining methodologies or architecture choices we present chessqa a comprehensive benchmark that assesses llm chess understanding across five task categories structural motifs short tactics position judgment and semantic which imately correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate chess knowledge from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to correctly calculating tactics evaluating positions and semantically describing highlevel concepts in this way chessqa captures a more comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding going significantly beyond the ple move quality evaluations done previously and offers a controlled consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison furthermore chessqa is inherently dynamic with prompts answer keys and construction scripts that can evolve as models improve evaluating a range of contemporary llms we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide results and error analyses by category we will release the code periodically refreshed datasets and a public leaderboard to support further research we introduce a novel training free cascade for autoprompting large language models llms to assess product quality in ecommerce our system requires no training labels or model finetuning instead automatically generating and refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of product categoryattribute pairs starting from a seed of humancrafted prompts the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet catalogspecific requirements this approach bridges the gap between general language understanding and domainspecific knowledge at scale in complex industrial catalogs our extensive empirical evaluations shows the autoprompt cascade improves precision and recall by over traditional chainofthought prompting notably it achieves these gains while reducing domain expert effort from hours to minutes per attribute a reduction additionally the cascade generalizes effectively across five languages and multiple quality assessment tasks consistently maintaining performance gains in this work a threedimensional multicomponent reactiondiffusion model has been developed combining excitablesystem dynamics with diffusion processes and sharing conceptual features with the fitzhughnagumo model designed to capture the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems particularly electrophysiological processes the model was solved numerically to generate timeseries data these data were subsequently used to train and evaluate an echo state network esn which successfully reproduced the systems dynamic behavior the results demonstrate that ulating biological dynamics using datadriven multifunctional esn models is both feasible and effective we present a security framework that strengthens distributed machine learning by standardizing integrity protections across cpu and gpu platforms and significantly reducing verification overheads our approach colocates integrity verification directly with large ml model execution on gpu accelerators resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ml workloads typically run primarily on gpus and how security verifications traditionally operate on separate cpubased processes delivering both immediate performance benefits and longterm architectural consistency by performing cryptographic operations natively on gpus using dedicated compute units eg intel arcs xmx units nvidias tensor cores our solution eliminates the potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional cpubased verification systems when dealing with large models this approach leverages the same gpubased highmemory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives that power ml workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model execution even for massive models exceeding gb this framework establishes a common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across different gpu vendors and hardware configurations by anticipating future capabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution environments and gpu accelerators we provide a hardwareagnostic foundation that enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying cpu and gpu infrastructures the black summer bushfires in australia devastated million hectares destroyed homes and lasted seven months demonstrating the escalating scale and urgency of wildfire threats requiring better forecasting for effective response traditional fire modeling relies on manual interpretation by fire behaviour analysts fbans and static environmental data often leading to inaccuracies and operational limitations emerging data sources such as nasas firms satellite imagery and volunteered geographic information offer potential improvements by enabling dynamic fire spread prediction this study proposes a multimodal fire spread prediction framework mfisp that integrates social media data and remote sensing observations to enhance forecast accuracy by adapting fuel map manipulation strategies between assimilation cycles the framework dynamically adjusts fire behavior predictions to align with the observed rate of spread we evaluate the efficacy of mfisp using synthetically generated fire event polygons across multiple scenarios analyzing individual and combined impacts on forecast perimeters results suggest that our mfisp integrating multimodal data can improve fire spread prediction beyond conventional methods reliant on fban expertise and static inputs we present a novel agentbased approach for the automated claim matching task with instructionfollowing llms we propose a twostep pipeline that first generates prompts with llms to then perform claim matching as a binary classification task with llms we demonstrate that llmgenerated prompts can outperform sota with humangenerated prompts and that smaller llms can do as well as larger ones in the generation process allowing to save computational resources we also demonstrate the effectiveness of using different llms for each step of the pipeline ie using an llm for prompt generation and another for claim matching our investigation into the prompt generation process in turn reveals insights into the llms understanding of claim matching the query key value weight triplet is a building block of current attention mechanisms in stateoftheart llms we theoretically investigate whether this triplet can be reduced proving under plifying assumptions that the query weights are redundant thereby reducing the number of nonembeddinglmhead parameters by over we validate the theory on fullcomplexity gpt small architectures with layer normalization skip connections and weight decay trained from scratch demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable validation loss to standard baselines these findings motivate the investigation of the query weight redundancy at scale scenelevel captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure by aligning visual cues with textual guidance this understanding supports procedural learning and multimodal reasoning providing a richer context for skill acquisition however captions that fail to capture this structure may lack coherence and quality which can create confusion and undermine the videos educational intent to address this gap we introduce dynastride a pipeline to generate coherent scenelevel captions without requiring manual scene segmentation using the youcookii datasets scene annotations dynastride performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key transitions within each scene it then employs a multimodal chainofthought process to produce multiple actionobject pairs which are refined and fused using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances temporal context and redundancy the final scenelevel caption integrates visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption empirical evaluations against strong baselines including vllama and gpto demonstrate consistent gains on both ngrambased metrics bleu meteor and semantic ilarity measures bertscore clipscore qualitative analyses further show that dynastride produces captions that are more temporally coherent and informative suggesting a promising direction for improving aipowered instructional content generation causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables enhancing predictions decisionmaking and insights into realworld systems especially in nonlinear multivariate time series however most existing methods primarily focus on pairwise causeeffect relationships overlooking interactions among groups of variables ie subsystems and their collective causal influence in this study we introduce gcdmi a novel multigroup causal discovery method that leverages grouplevel interventions on trained deep neural networks and employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships our approach involves three key steps first we use deep learning to jointly model the structural relationships among groups of all time series second we apply groupwise interventions to the trained model finally we conduct model invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable groups we evaluate our method on ulated datasets demonstrating its superior performance in identifying grouplevel causal relationships compared to existing methods additionally we validate our approach on realworld datasets including brain networks and climate ecosystems our results highlight that applying grouplevel interventions to deep learning models combined with invariance testing can effectively reveal complex causal structures offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and climate science mixedinteger programming mip has emerged as a powerful framework for learning optimal decision trees yet existing mip approaches for regression tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally intractable when continuous largescale data are involved naively binarizing continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly deep trees we recast the optimal regressiontree training as a twostage optimization problem and propose reducedspace optimal regression trees rsort a specialized branchandbound bb algorithm that branches exclusively on treestructural variables this design guarantees the algorithms convergence and its independence from the number of training samples leveraging the models structure we introduce several bound tightening techniques closedform leaf prediction empirical threshold discretization and exact depth subtree parsing that combine with decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training the bb nodewise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution further alleviating the computational intractability even for millionsize datasets based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both binary and continuous features rsort also delivers superior training and testing performance than stateoftheart methods notably on datasets with up to samples with continuous features rsort can obtain guaranteed training performance with a pler tree structure and a better generalization ability in four hours background systems of systems are becoming increasingly dynamic and heterogeneous and this adds pressure on the longstanding challenge of interoperability besides its technical aspect interoperability has also an economic side as development time efforts are required to build the interoperability artifacts objectives with the recent advances in the field of large language models llms we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of llmbased strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously at runtime without human intervention method we selected open source llms and curated four versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case we performed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset using two different strategies then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the consistency of their results across multiple runs results qwencoderb was the most effective model using both strategies direct average pass and codegen average pass in three out of four dataset versions in the fourth dataset version which included an unit conversion all models using the strategy direct failed whereas using codegen qwencoderb succeeded with an average pass conclusion some llms can make systems interoperate autonomously further evaluation in different domains is recommended and further research on reliability strategies should be conducted text watermarking for large language models llms enables model owners to verify text origin and protect intellectual property while watermarking methods for closedsource llms are relatively mature extending them to opensource models remains challenging as developers cannot control the decoding process consequently owners of opensource llms lack practical means to verify whether text was generated by their models a core difficulty lies in embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability a promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closedsource model into an open one but this suffers from i poor detectability due to mismatch between learned and predefined patterns and ii fragility to downstream modifications such as finetuning or model merging to overcome these limitations we propose pro a precise and robust text watermarking method for opensource llms pro jointly trains a watermark policy model with the llm producing patterns that are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria a regularization term further ulates downstream perturbations and penalizes degradation in watermark detectability ensuring robustness under model edits experiments on opensource llms eg llama llama phi show that pro substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model modifications we present oraplansql our system for the archer nlsql evaluation challenge a bilingual benchmark requiring complex reasoning such as arithmetic commonsense and hypothetical inference oraplansql ranked first exceeding the secondbest system by more than in execution accuracy ex with in english and in chinese while maintaining over sql validity va our system follows an agentic framework with two components planner agent that generates stepwise natural language plans and sql agent that converts these plans into executable sql since sql agent reliably adheres to the plan our refinements focus on the planner unlike prior methods that rely on multiple subagents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead we introduce a feedbackguided metaprompting strategy to refine a single planner failure cases from a heldout set are clustered with human input and an llm distills them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planners system prompt improving generalization without added complexity for the multilingual scenario to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues we incorporate entitylinking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities and explicitly include them in the plan finally we enhance reliability through plan diversification multiple candidate plans are generated for each query with the sql agent producing a query for each plan and final output selected via majority voting over their executions this work presents a physicsconditioned latent diffusion model tailored for dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data with a focus on reconstructing highresolution temperature fields building upon a preexisting diffusion architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference unet we integrate a partial differential equation pde loss term into the models training objective the pde loss is computed in the full resolution pixel space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical consistency through a finitedifference imation of an effective advectiondiffusion balance empirical observations indicate that conventional diffusion training already yields low pde residuals and we investigate how finetuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields the entirety of our codebase is available on github for future reference and development in modern industry systems like multiturn chat agents texttosql technology bridges natural language nl questions and database db querying the conversion of tabular db results into nl representations nlrs enables the chatbased interaction currently nlr generation is typically handled by large language models llms but information loss or errors in presenting tabular results in nl remains largely unexplored this paper introduces a novel evaluation method comboeval for judgment of llmgenerated nlrs that combines the benefits of multiple existing methods optimizing evaluation fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in llm calls by accompanying our method is nlrbird the first dedicated dataset for nlr benchmarking through human evaluations we demonstrate the superior alignment of comboeval with human judgments applicable across scenarios with and without ground truth references contextual biasing improves automatic speech recognition asr by integrating external knowledge such as userspecific phrases or entities during decoding in this work we use an attentionbased biasing decoder to produce scores for candidate phrases based on acoustic information extracted by an asr encoder which can be used to filter out unlikely phrases and to calculate bonus for shallowfusion biasing we introduce a pertoken discriminative objective that encourages higher scores for groundtruth phrases while suppressing distractors experiments on the librispeech biasing benchmark show that our method effectively filters out majority of the candidate phrases and significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions when the scores are used in shallow fusion biasing our approach is modular and can be used with any asr system and the filtering mechanism can potentially boost performance of other biasing methods detecting mental health crisis situations such as suicide ideation rape domestic violence child abuse and sexual harassment is a critical yet underexplored challenge for language models when such situations arise during usermodel interactions models must reliably flag them as failure to do so can have serious consequences in this work we introduce cradle bench a benchmark for multifaceted crisis detection unlike previous efforts that focus on a limited set of crisis types our benchmark covers seven types defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate temporal labels our benchmark provides clinicianannotated evaluation examples and development examples together with a training corpus of around examples automatically labeled using a majorityvote ensemble of multiple language models which significantly outperforms singlemodel annotation we further finetune six crisis detection models on subsets defined by consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement providing complementary models trained under different agreement criteria the proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a pressing environmental concern exerting a detrimental influence on biodiversity water quality and human activities such as navigation and recreation the present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the monitoring the aforementioned waste utilising fixed insitu cameras this study provides two key contributions i the continuous quantification and monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and ii the identification of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference speed under complex environmental conditions these models are tested in a range of environmental conditions and learning configurations including experiments on biases related to data leakage furthermore a geometric model is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a image this model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of the camera the findings of this study underscore the significance of the dataset constitution protocol particularly with respect to the integration of negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage in conclusion the feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with regression corrections is demonstrated this approach paves the way for the development of robust lowcost automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic environments humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity however most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability they often miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes internal symmetry or overlapping components in this work we introduce countformer a transformerbased framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for classagnostic object counting built upon the countr architecture our model replaces its visual encoder with the selfsupervised foundation model dinov which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations we further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a lightweight convolutional decoder evaluated on the fsc dataset our model achieves performance comparable to current stateoftheart methods while demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed scenes our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as dinov enables counting systems to approach humanlike structural perception advancing toward a truly general and exemplarfree counting paradigm the increasing realism of aigenerated imagery poses challenges for verifying visual authenticity we present an explainable image authenticity detection system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier fasterthanlies with a visionlanguage model qwenvlb to classify localize and explain

artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text generation for each detected anomaly this work highlights the feasibility of combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity detection in lowresolution imagery and outlines potential crossdomain applications in forensics industrial inspection and social media moderation we introduce tdflow a novel testdriven agentic workflow that frames repositoryscale software engineering as a testresolution task specifically designed to solve humanwritten tests given a set of tests tdflow repeatedly proposes revises and debugs repositoryscale patches using precisely engineered subagents and tightly constrained tools the workflow decomposes software engineering program repair into four components governed by respective subagents this ple forced decoupling of patch proposing debugging patch revision and optional test generation reduces longcontext burden on any individual subagent focuses each subagent on specific predefined subtasks and allows for specialized performance improvement on specific subtasks when provided humanwritten tests tdflow attains pass rate on swebench lite an absolute improvement of over the next best system and on swebench verified manual inspection of the tdflow runs within swebench lite and verified uncover only instances of test hacking which were subsequently counted as failures furthermore we show that the primary obstacle to humanlevel software engineering performance lies within writing successful reproduction tests we envision a humanllm interactive system powered by tdflow where human developers write tests solved by llm systems together these results indicate that modern llms when embedded in a narrowly engineered testdriven workflow already achieve humanlevel test resolution with the final frontier for fully autonomous repository repair being the accurate generation of valid reproduction tests catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing what they have previously learned in prior work we introduced cobwebv a hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic forgetting in visual domains motivated by this robustness we examine three hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention sparse and selective updates reduce interference and informationtheoretic learning based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradientbased backpropagation to test these hypotheses we compare cobwebv with neural baselines including cobwebnn a neural implementation of the cobweb framework introduced in this work experiments on datasets of varying complexity mnist fashionmnist medmnist and cifar show that adaptive restructuring enhances learning plasticity sparse updates help mitigate interference and the informationtheoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without revisiting past data together these findings provide insight into mechanisms that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of conceptbased informationtheoretic approaches for building stable and adaptive continual learning systems recent alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback have been widely adopted to align large language models with human preferences by learning and leveraging reward models in practice these models often exploit spurious correlations involving eg response length discrimination sycophancy and conceptual bias which is a problem that has received increasing attention in this work we propose a principled framework that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying factors that reflect intended preferences we first provide a formulation of the datagenerating process assuming that the observed data eg text is generated from both spurious and nonspurious latent variables we show that interestingly these nonspurious latent variables can be theoretically identified from data regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent variables is available this further inspires a practical method that uses variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train reward models experiments on synthetic and realworld datasets demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields more robust reward models this phd thesis investigates the societal impact of machine learning ml ml increasingly informs consequential decisions and recommendations significantly affecting many aspects of our lives as these datadriven systems are often developed without explicit fairness considerations they carry the risk of discriminatory effects the contributions in this thesis enable more appropriate measurement of fairness in ml systems systematic decomposition of ml systems to anticipate bias dynamics and effective interventions that reduce algorithmic discrimination while maintaining system utility i conclude by discussing ongoing challenges and future research directions as ml systems including generative artificial intelligence become increasingly integrated into society this work offers a foundation for ensuring that mls societal impact aligns with broader social values the nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors posing fundamental challenges for accurately predicting their evolution to overcome the limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and global dependencies in chaotic time series ultaneously this study proposes a parallel predictive framework integrating transformer and bidirectional long shortterm memory bilstm networks the hybrid model employs a dualbranch architecture where the transformer branch mainly captures longrange dependencies while the bilstm branch focuses on extracting local temporal features the complementary representations from the two branches are fused in a dedicated featurefusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy as illustrating examples the models performance is systematically evaluated on two representative tasks in the lorenz system the first is autonomous evolution prediction in which the model recursively extrapolates system trajectories from the timedelay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate longterm tracking accuracy and stability the second is inference of unmeasured variable where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from the timedelay embeddings of partial observations to assess its statecompletion capability the results consistently indicate that the proposed hybrid framework outperforms both singlebranch architectures across tasks demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system prediction large language models show promise as autonomous decisionmaking agents yet their deployment in highstakes domains remains fraught with risk without architectural safeguards llm agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on prompt framing we present chimera a neurosymboliccausal architecture

baseline architectures llmonly llm with symbolic constraints across week ulations in a realistic ecommerce environment featuring price elasticity trust dynamics and seasonal demand under organizational biases toward either volume or margin optimization llmonly agents fail catastrophically total loss of in volume scenarios or destroy brand trust in margin scenarios adding symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only of chimeras profit chimera consistently delivers the highest returns and respectively some cases while improving brand trust and some cases demonstrating promptagnostic robustness our tla formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios these results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments we provide opensource implementations and interactive demonstrations for reproducibility modern coding agents integrated into ides combine powerful tools and systemlevel actions exposing a highstakes attack surface existing indirect prompt injection ipi studies focus mainly on queryspecific behaviors leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates we identify a more severe queryagnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user inputs this challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability leakage of the agents internal prompt which turns the attack into a constrained whitebox optimization problem we present queryipi the first queryagnostic ipi method for coding agents queryipi refines malicious tool descriptions through an iterative promptbased process informed by the leaked internal prompt experiments on five ulated agents show that queryipi achieves up to percent success outperforming baselines and the generated malicious descriptions also transfer to realworld systems highlighting a practical security risk to modern llmbased coding agents security in code generation remains a pivotal challenge when applying large language models llms this paper introduces reflexgen an innovative method that significantly enhances code security by integrating retrievalaugmented

that can be resourceintensive reflexgen iteratively optimizes the code generation process through selfassessment and reflection without the need for extensive resources within this framework the model continuously accumulates and refines its knowledge base thereby progressively improving the security of the generated code experimental results demonstrate that reflexgen substantially enhances code security across multiple models achieving a improvement with gpt turbo a improvement with gpto a improvement with codeqwen and a improvement with gemini our findings highlight that improving the quality of model selfreflection constitutes an effective and practical strategy for strengthening the security of aigenerated code the model context protocol mcp has emerged as a standardized interface enabling seamless integration between large language models llms and external data sources and tools while mcp significantly reduces development complexity and enhances agent capabilities its openness and extensibility introduce critical security vulnerabilities that threaten system trustworthiness and user data protection this paper systematically analyzes the security landscape of mcpbased systems identifying three principal threat categories agent hijacking attacks stemming from protocol design deficiencies traditional web vulnerabilities in mcp servers and supply chain security to address these challenges we comprehensively survey existing defense strategies examining both proactive serverside scanning approaches ranging from layered detection pipelines and agentic auditing frameworks to zerotrust registry systems and runtime interaction monitoring solutions that provide continuous oversight and policy enforcement our analysis reveals that mcp security fundamentally represents a paradigm shift where the attack surface extends from traditional code execution to semantic interpretation of natural language metadata necessitating novel defense mechanisms tailored to this unique threat model mixture of experts moe models have become central to scaling large language models yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly understood previous work has explored how dense models use superposition to represent more features than dimensions and how superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance moe models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens we find that neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase changes and that network sparsity the ratio of active to total experts better characterizes moes we develop new metrics for measuring superposition across experts our findings demonstrate that models with greater network sparsity exhibit greater monosemanticity we propose a new definition of expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than load balancing showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature combinations when initialized appropriately these results suggest that network sparsity in moes may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing performance challenging the common assumption that interpretability and capability are fundamentally at odds purpose the rapid integration of artificial intelligence ai systems like chatgpt claude ai etc has a deep impact on how work

residual components then a long short term memory lstm network models long term trends an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model captures seasonal periodicity and an extreme gradient boosting xgboost algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations the final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model predictions using traffic flow records from a new york city intersection between november and december results show that the lstm arima xgboost hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including lstm arima and xgboost across mae rmse and squared metrics the decomposition strategy effectively isolates temporal characteristics allowing each model to specialize thereby improving prediction accuracy interpretability and robustness

introduce tempest transformers from compressed representations a method that exploits the inherent bytestream structure of compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy by leveraging this compact encoding a standard transformer can directly learn semantic representations from compressed data streams bypassing the need for raw bytelevel processing or full media decoding our proposal substantially reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification thereby lowering both computational complexity and memory usage through extensive experiments across diverse datasets coding schemes and modalities we show that tempest achieves accuracy competitive wit the stateoftheart while delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute the emergence of agentic

lays the foundation for integrating quantum computing into deeplearningdriven medical diagnostic systems offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional approaches diffusion language models dllms are an emerging alternative to autoregressive ar generators but aligning them to human preferences is challenging because sequence loglikelihoods are intractable and pairwise preference

viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion llms deep neural networks dnns play a significant role in an increasing body of research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data a general assumption of training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated however this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data this gap limits the performance of dnnbased forecasting models and is overlooked by current studies to fill up this gap this paper proposes spatiotemporally autocorrelated error adjustment saea a novel and general framework designed to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic forecasting unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a random gaussian noise distribution saea models these errors as a spatiotemporal vector autoregressive var process to capture their intrinsic dependencies first it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error correlations by a coefficient matrix which is then embedded into a newly formulated cost function second a structurally sparse regularization is introduced to incorporate prior spatial information ensuring that the learned coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure finally an inference process with testtime error adjustment is designed to dynamically refine predictions mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in realtime forecasting the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on different traffic datasets results across a wide range of traffic forecasting models show that our method

moreover the approach shows practicality and scalability for realworld operations supporting realtime updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information any digital personal assistant whether used to support task performance answer questions or manage work and daily life including fitness schedules requires highquality annotations to function properly however user annotations whether actively produced or inferred from context eg data from smartphone sensors are often subject to errors and noise previous research on skeptical learning skel addressed the issue of noisy labels by comparing offline active annotations with passive data allowing for an evaluation of annotation accuracy however this evaluation did not include confirmation from endusers the best judges of their own context in this study we evaluate skels performance in realworld conditions with actual users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and needs the study involves university students using the ilog mobile application on their devices over a period of four weeks the results highlight the challenges of finding the right balance between user effort

we consider the following fundamental problem can we design settovector functions so that the natural partial order on sets is preserved namely ssubseteq text if and only if fsleq ft we call functions satisfying this property monotone and separating mas set functions we establish lower and upper bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain mas functions as a function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set in the important case of an infinite ground set we show that mas functions do not exist but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed mas property we name weakly mas and is stable in the sense of holder continuity we also show that mas functions can be used to construct universal models that are monotone by construction and can imate all monotone set functions experimentally we consider a variety of set containment tasks the experiments show the benefit of using our our model in comparison with standard set models which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias our code is available in pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in zeroshot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into the generation process of the diffusion models however this presents an inherent dilemma excessive integration can disrupt the generative process while insufficient integration fails to asize the constraints imposed by the inverse problem to address this we propose noise combination sampling a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise subspace to imate the measurement score replacing the noise term in the standard denoising diffusion probabilistic models process this enables conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process without reliance on stepwise hyperparameter tuning our method can be applied to a wide range of inverse problem solvers including image compression and particularly when the number of generation steps is small achieves superior performance with negligible computational overhead significantly improving robustness and stability the rapid growth of highresolution scientific

data llmcomp first quantizes fields into discrete tokens arranges them via zorder curves to preserve locality and applies coverageguided sampling to enhance training efficiency an autoregressive transformer is then trained with spatialtemporal embeddings to model token transitions during compression the model performs topk prediction storing only rank indices and fallback corrections to ensure strict error bounds experiments on multiple reanalysis datasets show that llmcomp consistently outperforms stateoftheart compressors achieving up to higher compression ratios under strict error bounds these results highlight the potential of llms as generalpurpose compressors for highfidelity scientific data alignment of large language models llms has predominantly relied on pairwise preference optimization where annotators select the better of two responses to a prompt while ple this approach overlooks the opportunity to learn from richer forms of human feedback such as multiwise comparisons and topk rankings we propose ranked choice preference optimization rcpo a unified framework that bridges preference optimization with ranked choice modeling via maximum likelihood estimation the framework is flexible supporting both utilitybased and rankbased choice models it subsumes several existing pairwise methods eg dpo po while providing principled training objectives for richer feedback formats we instantiate this framework with two representative ranked choice models multinomial logit and mallowsrmj empirical studies on llamabinstruct and gemmabit across alpacaeval

interpretable structured events from numerical inputs even when current text is unavailable to address the data scarcity and semantic alignment challenges we propose a reasoningaware framework that integrates an agentguided event extractor age a marked multivariate hawkesbased synthetic generator evedts and a twostage finetuning pipeline combining a timeseries encoder with a structured decoder our model explicitly reasons over numerical changes generates intermediate explanations and outputs structured event hypotheses experiments on multidomain datasets show that our method substantially outperforms strong llm baselines in eventlevel precision and recall these results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative reasoning and semantic understanding enabling llms to explain and predict events directly from numerical dynamics building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the development of large language models llms recent efforts increasingly turn to

healthcare environments future work includes integrating imaging and lab data multilingual extensions and clinical trial validation pretrained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn from context known as incontext learning icl despite a surge of recent applications that leverage such capabilities it is by no means clear at least theoretically how the icl capabilities arise and in particular what is the precise role played by key factors such as pretraining procedure as well as context construction in this work we propose a new framework to analyze the icl performance for a class of realistic settings which includes network architectures data encoding data generation and prompt construction process as a first step we construct a ple example with a onelayer transformer and show an interesting result namely when the pretrain data distribution is different from the query task distribution a properly constructed context can shift the output

derive the precise relationship between icl performance context length and the kl divergence between pretrain and query task distribution finally we provide experiments to validate our theoretical results in todays rapidly expanding data landscape knowledge extraction from unstructured text is vital for realtime analytics temporal inference and dynamic memory frameworks however traditional static knowledge graph kg construction often overlooks the dynamic and timesensitive nature of realworld data limiting adaptability to continuous changes moreover recent zero or fewshot approaches

introduce atom adaptive and optimized a fewshot and scalable approach that builds and continuously updates temporal knowledge graphs tkgs from unstructured texts atom splits input documents into minimal selfcontained atomic facts improving extraction exhaustivity and stability then it constructs atomic tkgs from these facts while employing a dualtime modeling that distinguishes when

abilities when they generate stepbystep solutions known as chainofthought cot reasoning when trained to using chainofthought reasoning examples the resulting models called large reasoning models or lrms appear to learn hierarchical thinking strategies ilar to those used by humans however understanding lrms emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open problem with many potential important applications including improving training and understanding robustness in this paper we adopt a memoryless finite state machine formulation to imate lrms emerging hierarchical reasoning dynamics as a structured interpretable abstraction we identify a small set of discrete reasoning states including initialization deduction augmentationstrategy uncertaintyestimation backtracking and finalconclusion that capture the highlevel states present in the models reasoning process by annotating each step of a models cot with these states we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a

reasoning models lrms llms finetuned with incentives for stepbystep argumentation and selfverification lrm performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as nlgraph seem extraordinary with some even claiming they are capable of generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoningintensive fields such as mathematics physics medicine and law however by more carefully scaling the complexity of reasoning problems we show existing benchmarks actually have limited complexity we develop a new dataset the deep reasoning dataset deeprd along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of scalable complexity we use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph connectivity and natural language proof planning we find that the performance of lrms drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize we also relate our lrm results to the distributions of the complexities of large realworld knowledge graphs interaction graphs and proof datasets we find the majority of realworld examples fall inside the lrms success regime yet the long tails expose substantial failure potential our analysis highlights the nearterm utility of lrms while underscoring the need for new methods that generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that integrates spatial

fixedstep decomposition often fails to achieve high performance to address this challenge we introduce optitree a novel tree search approach designed to enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem decomposition into pler subproblems specifically we develop a modeling tree that organizes a wide range of or problems based on their hierarchical problem taxonomy and complexity with each node representing a problem category and containing relevant highlevel modeling thoughts given a problem to model we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of pler subproblems and synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the hierarchical thoughts experiments show that optitree significantly improves the modeling accuracy compared to the

artificial neural systems finding an optimal solution for synaptic cap means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals gradientbased methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using backpropagation however not in the most efficient way for instance backpropagation requires a chain of topdown gradient computations this leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with wellknown weight transport and update locking problems to address these shortcomings we take a neuroai approach and draw inspiration from neural reinforcement learning to develop a derivativefree optimizer for training neural networks dopamine dopamine is developed for weight perturbation wp learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima it achieves this by minimizing the regret a form of reward prediction error rpe between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model we use this rpe to adjust the learning rate in the network ie creating an adaptive learning rate strategy ilar to the role of dopamine in the brain we tested the dopamine optimizer for training multilayered perceptrons for xor tasks and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting dopaminetrained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard wp and give comparable performance to gradientbased algorithms while consuming significantly less computation and memory overall the dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the stateoftheart machine learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible ai psychometrics evaluates

states despite these advancements deploying agentic ai faces technical hurdles and ethical concerns due to the lack of comprehensive discussion on this emerging direction this position paper argues that the field is poised for a paradigm extension from bci to brainagent collaboration bac we asize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors demanding a focus on ethical data handling model reliability and a robust humanagent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe trustworthy and effective the field of artificial intelligence ai has taken a tight hold on broad aspects of society industry business and governance in ways that dictate the prosperity and might of the worlds economies the ai market size is projected to grow from billion usd in to trillion usd by currently ai is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual intelligence however training these models requires a massive amount of data scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy gwh to train gpt despite these costs these models often hallucinate a characteristic that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains in contrast the human brain consumes only of power what is needed is the next level of ai evolution in which lightweight domainspecific multimodal models with higher levels of intelligence can reason plan and make decisions in dynamic environments with realtime data and prior knowledge while learning continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decisionmaking capability this will define the next wave of ai progressing from todays large models trained with vast amounts of data to nimble energyefficient domainspecific agents that can reason and think in a world full of uncertainty to support such agents hardware will need to be reimagined to allow energy efficiencies greater than over the state of the art such a vision of future ai systems is developed in this work contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy yet systems that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque their internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention we can retrain such models but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while holding others fixed because learned latent variables lack causal semantics we argue for a conceptual reorientation intelligence is the ability to build and refine explanations falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention explanations subsume prediction but demand more causal commitments that can be independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms we introduce computational explanations mappings from observations to intervention ready causal accounts we instantiate these explanations with energy structured causal models escms in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints energy functions or vector fields rather than explicit input output maps and interventions act by local surgery on those constraints this shift makes internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live which relations must hold which can change and what follows when they do we provide concrete instantiations of the structuralcausal principles lap and icm in the escm context and also argue that empirical risk minimization systematically produces fractured entangled representations a failure we analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs finally we show that under mild conditions escms recover standard scm semantics building on part is principles lap icm cap and its definition of intelligence as explanationbuilding under criticism this paper offers a formal language for causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand not merely to predict we present a case study applying the specc methodology within a systemlevel

implementation on a highend processor despite the designs moderate complexity the results underline the value of systemlevel codesign for early architectural insight rapid validation and actionable costperformance tradeoffs original work from formatting revised in with no changes to the results learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and generalization in partially observable environments while metareinforcement learning rl agents can attain near bayesoptimal policies they often fail to learn the compact interpretable bayesoptimal belief states this representational inefficiency potentially limits the agents adaptability and generalization capacity inspired by predictive coding in neurosciencewhich suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of bayesian inferenceand by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep rl we investigate whether integrating selfsupervised predictive coding modules into metarl can facilitate learning of bayesoptimal representations through state machine ulation we show that metarl with predictive modules consistently generates more interpretable representations that better imate bayesoptimal belief states compared to conventional metarl across a wide variety of tasks even when both achieve optimal policies in challenging tasks requiring active information seeking only metarl with predictive modules successfully learns optimal representations and policies whereas conventional metarl struggles with inadequate representation learning finally we demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved generalization our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating partial observability large language models llms can already identify patterns and reason effectively yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in highstakes decisionmaking applications in this paper we study this issue from a venture capital perspective by predicting ideastage startup success based on founder traits i to build a reliable prediction model we introduce llmar a pipeline inspired by neuralsymbolic systems that distils llmgenerated heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the problog automatedreasoning engine ii an iterative policyevolution loop incorporates associationrule mining to progressively refine the prediction rules on unseen folds llmar achieves precision and recall the random baseline precision while exposing every decision path for human inspection the framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters showing promise to extend into other domains with the advancement of multimodal large language models mllms building gui agent systems has become an increasingly promising directionespecially for mobile platforms given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch interactions yet mobile gui agents face a critical dilemma truly ondevice models or smaller lack sufficient performance while capable models starting from are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively costly eg cloudonly closedsource mllms to resolve this we propose lightagent a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages devicecloud collaboration to tap the costefficiency of ondevice models and the high capability of cloud

the online androidlab benchmark and diverse apps show lightagent matches or nears larger models with a significant reduction in cloud costs math word problem mwp serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial intelligence ai dating back to this research aims to advance the reasoning abilities of ai by mirroring the humanlike cognitive intelligence the mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rulebased methods to deep learning models and is rapidly advancing towards large language models however the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the mwp survey along with a discussion of current development trends therefore in this paper we aim to comprehensively review related research in mwp solving through the lens of human cognition to demonstrate how recent ai models are advancing in ulating human cognitive abilities specifically we summarize crucial cognitive abilities for mwp solving including problem understanding logical organization associative memory critical thinking and knowledge learning focused on these abilities we review two mainstream mwp models in recent years neural network solvers and llm based solvers and discuss the core humanlike abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problemsolving process moreover we rerun all the representative mwp solvers and supplement their performance on mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison to the best of our knowledge this survey first comprehensively analyzes the influential mwp research of the past decade from the perspective of human reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across existing approaches we hope it can inspire further research in ai reasoning our repository is released on large language models llms offer a promising way to ulate human survey responses potentially reducing the cost of largescale data collection however existing zeroshot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low accuracy while conventional finetuning approaches mostly fit the training set distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training set itself which deviates from the original goal of using llms to ulate survey responses building on this observation we introduce distribution shift alignment dsa a twostage finetuning method that aligns both the output distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds by learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data dsa can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the training data empirically dsa consistently outperforms other methods on five public survey datasets we further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering accuracy robustness and data savings dsa reduces the required real data by demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey ulation large language models llms offer stateoftheart performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks however the deployment of leading commercial models for specialized tasks such as ecommerce is often hindered by high computational costs latency and operational expenses this paper investigates the viability of smaller openweight models as a resourceefficient alternative we present a methodology for optimizing a onebillionparameter llama model for multilingual ecommerce intent recognition the model was finetuned using quantized lowrank adaptation qlora on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic realworld user queries subsequently we applied posttraining quantization techniques creating gpuoptimized gptq and cpuoptimized gguf versions our results demonstrate that the specialized model achieves accuracy matching the performance of the significantly larger gpt model a detailed performance analysis revealed critical hardwaredependent tradeoffs while bit gptq reduced vram usage by it paradoxically slowed inference by on an older gpu architecture nvidia due to dequantization overhead conversely gguf formats on a cpu achieved a speedup of up to in inference throughput and a reduction of over in ram consumption compared to the fp baseline we conclude that small properly optimized openweight models are not just a viable but a more suitable alternative for domainspecific applications offering stateoftheart accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost this paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement learning in a novel linear function imation regime termed partial qpirealizability in this framework the objective is to learn an epsilonoptimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set pi under the assumption that all value functions for policies in pi are linearly realizable the assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in qpirealizability but stronger than those in qrealizability providing a practical model where function imation naturally arises we prove that learning an epsilonoptimal policy in this setting is computationally hard specifically we establish nphardness under a parameterized greedy policy set argmax and show that unless np rp an exponential lower bound in feature vector dimension holds when the policy set contains softmax policies under the randomized exponential time hypothesis our hardness results mirror those in qrealizability and suggest computational difficulty persists even when pi is expanded beyond the optimal policy to establish this we reduce from two complexity problems deltamaxsat and deltamaxsatb to instances of glinearkapparl greedy policy and slinearkapparl softmax policy our findings indicate that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial qpirealizability in contrast to qpirealizability under a generative access model this work applies generative flow networks gflownets to three graph optimization problems the traveling salesperson problem minimum spanning tree and shortest path gflownets are generative models that learn to sample solutions proportionally to a reward function the models are trained using the trajectory balance loss to build solutions sequentially se lecting edges for spanning trees nodes for paths and cities for tours experiments on benchmark instances of varying sizes show that gflownets learn to find optimal solutions for each problem type multiple graph configurations with different numbers of nodes were tested the generated solutions match those from classical algorithms dijkstra for shortest path kruskal for spanning trees and exact solvers for tsp training convergence depends on problem complexity with the number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size grows once training converges the generated solutions match known optima from classical algorithms across the tested instances this work demonstrates that generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned policies the main advantage of this learningbased approach is computational scalability while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance gflownets amortize computation through training with sufficient computational resources the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances where classical exact methods become infeasible large language models llms have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in textbased mathematical problem solving however when adapted to visual reasoning tasks particularly geometric problem solving their performance substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges specifically these challenges stem from two key factors first the intrinsic complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multistep reasoning and second the limitations of existing datasets which lack sufficient scale diversity and explicit reasoning traces consequently hindering effective model training to address these challenges we developed the geothoughts dataset a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two subsets geothoughtk with samples and its augmented version geothoughtaugmentedk containing samples each entry includes visual descriptions stepbystep solutions explicit reasoning chains reflection steps and final answers using this dataset we developed geothoughtmllm a mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking processes during problemsolving our model outperforms existing benchmarks in geometric tasks demonstrating that training with our chainofthought dataset improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both indomain and outofdomain settings finally we analyze failure cases and observe that errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts or spatial misjudgment by invoking cot to correct these mistakes the model produces correct answers we document empirical capability ceilings in decoderonly autoregressive language models across knowledgeintensive tasks systematic evaluation of opt and pythia model families mb parameters spanning times scaling reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement despite smooth loss reduction on mmlu mathematics benchmarks accuracy remains flat at below random chance across all scales while crossentropy loss decreases by in contrast procedural tasks like arithmetic show conventional scaling where both metrics improve together attention intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation swapping attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse complete accuracy loss rather than graceful degradation these measurements have immediate engineering implications for knowledgeintensive applications using opt and pythia architectures parameter scaling beyond offers minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement our findings quantify capabilityspecific scaling failures in these model families to inform resource allocation decisions whether these patterns reflect fundamental constraints of decoderonly architectures or implementationspecific limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse architectural approaches realworld ai systems are tackling increasingly complex problems often through interactions among large language model llm agents when these agents develop inconsistent conventions coordination can break down applications such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require reliable consistent communication and scalability is a central concern as systems grow we introduce schemainduced games for naming sign a naming game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation we compare schemainduced communication to unconstrained natural language and find faster convergence with up to higher agreement these results suggest that minimal structure can act as a ple control knob for efficient multiagent coordination pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game while recent advances in large language models llms have improved the quality of creative text generation significant challenges remain in producing personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences conventional approaches rely on explicit feedback or finetuning which presents practical issues regarding user burden data collection computational costs and privacy in this work we propose prefine personaandrubric guided critiqueandrefine a novel framework that extends the critiqueandrefine paradigm to personalization prefine constructs a pseudouser agent from a users interaction history and generates userspecific rubrics evaluation criteria by having this agent critique and refine outputs on the users behalf based on these tailored rubrics our method achieves personalized generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback we conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the perdoc and permpst story datasets we designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the contribution of each component of our framework in automatic evaluations llmasajudge prefine achieved higher win rates and statistically significant scores than the baselines without compromising general story quality analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudouser agent and the userspecific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization performance beyond story generation our approach holds potential for enabling efficient personalization in broader applications such as dialogue systems education and recommendation the confluence of artificial intelligence and computational psychology presents an opportunity to model understand and interact with complex human psychological states through computational means this paper presents a comprehensive multifaceted framework designed to bridge the gap between isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological analysis the methodology encompasses a rigorous endtoend development lifecycle first foundational performance benchmarks were established on four diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques second stateoftheart transformer models were finetuned a process that necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical engineering challenges including the resolution of numerical instability in regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting largescale training under severe resource constraints third a generative large language model llm was finetuned using parameterefficient techniques to function as an interactive personality brain finally the entire suite of predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust scalable microservices ecosystem key findings include the successful stabilization of transformerbased regression models for affective computing showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed and the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing largescale ai research the significance of this work lies in its holistic approach demonstrating a complete researchtodeployment pipeline that integrates predictive analysis with generative dialogue thereby providing a practical model for future research in computational psychology and humanai interaction masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for discrete generative modeling however a key limitation of standard masked diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens that are predicted concurrently leading to degraded generation quality when dependencies among tokens are important to explicitly model dependencies among tokens we propose variational masked diffusion vmd a framework that introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets we demonstrate that vmd successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to capture we further validate the effectiveness of our approach on sudoku puzzles and text datasets where learning of dependencies among tokens improves global consistency across these domains vmd enhances both generation quality and dependency awareness highlighting the value of integrating variational inference into masked diffusion our code is available at current dd generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism efficiency and aesthetics however they often fail to preserve the semantic identity of the subject across different viewpoints adapting generation methods with one or few images of a specific subject also known as personalization or subjectdriven generation allows generating visual content that align with the identity of the subject however personalized dd generation is still largely underexplored in this work we introduce tire track inpaint resplat a novel method for subjectdriven dd generation it takes an initial asset produced by an existing generative model as input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified then we adopt a subjectdriven inpainting model for progressively infilling the identified regions finally we resplat the modified multiview observations back to while still maintaining consistency extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity preservation in dd generation compared to stateoftheart methods our project website is available at the rapid advancement of large language models llms has spurred the emergence of data agentsautonomous systems designed to orchestrate data ai ecosystems for tackling complex datarelated tasks however the term data agent currently suffers from terminological ambiguity and inconsistent adoption conflating ple query responders with sophisticated autonomous architectures this terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user expectations accountability challenges and barriers to industry growth inspired by the sae standard for driving automation this survey introduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents comprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy from manual operations to a vision of generative fully autonomous data agents thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility allocation through this lens we offer a structured review of existing research arranged by increasing autonomy encompassing specialized data agents for data management preparation and analysis alongside emerging efforts toward versatile comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy we further analyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data agents especially the ongoing ltol transition where data agents evolve from procedural execution to autonomous orchestration finally we conclude with a forwardlooking roadmap envisioning the advent of proactive generative data agents the identification of hope speech has become a promised nlp task considering the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goaldirected behaviour on social media platforms this proposal evaluates traditional machine learning models and finetuned transformers for a previously split hope speech dataset as train development and test set on development test a linearkernel svm and logistic regression both reached a macrof of svm with rbf kernel reached and nave bayes hit transformer models delivered better results the best model achieved weighted precision of weighted recall of weighted of macro of and accuracy these results suggest that while optimally configured traditional machine learning models remain agile transformer architectures detect some subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech detection suggesting that larges transformers and llms could perform better in small datasets temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions which are encoded in node embeddings we observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal interactions eg a few node pairs can make most interaction events and interaction events happen at varying intervals this leads to the problems of ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction existing methods however do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning process and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs to cope with the heterogeneity we propose a novel framework called tami which contains two effective components namely log time encoding function lte and link history aggregation lha lte better encodes the temporal information through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones and lha prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being forgotten stateoftheart temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly and readily integrated into tami to improve their effectiveness experiment results on classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark tgb datasets show that tami consistently improves the link prediction performance of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings our code is available at urban micromobility applications such as delivery robots demand reliable navigation across largescale urban environments while following longhorizon route instructions this task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of realworld city areas yet most existing navigation methods remain tailored to shortscale and controllable scenarios effective urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills lowlevel capabilities such as pointgoal reaching and obstacle avoidance and highlevel capabilities such as routevisual alignment to this end we propose urbanvla a routeconditioned visionlanguageaction vla framework designed for scalable urban navigation our method explicitly aligns noisy route waypoints with visual observations during execution and subsequently plans trajectories to drive the robot to enable urbanvla to master both levels of navigation we employ a twostage training pipeline the process begins with supervised finetuning sft using ulated environments and trajectories parsed from web videos this is followed by reinforcement finetuning rft on a mixture of ulation and realworld data which enhances the models safety and adaptability in realworld settings experiments demonstrate that urbanvla surpasses strong baselines by more than in the socialnav task on metaurban furthermore urbanvla achieves reliable realworld navigation showcasing both scalability to largescale urban environments and robustness against realworld uncertainties the pursuit of robot generalists instructable agents capable of performing diverse tasks across diverse environments demands rigorous and scalable evaluation yet realworld testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained it is laborintensive slow unsafe at scale and difficult to reproduce existing ulation benchmarks are ilarly limited as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from realworld demonstrations or alternative ulation environments as policies expand in scope and complexity these barriers only intensify since defining success in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality in this paper we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting vla evaluation into largescale ulated environments augmented with online human feedback leveraging advances in visionlanguage models dtod generative modeling and differentiable rendering our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into ulated counterparts within these digital twins we assess vla policies using both automated vlmguided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup resetting and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons to measure robustness we systematically perturb ulated environments along multiple axes such as textures and object placements stresstesting policy generalization under controlled variation the result is a continuously evolving reproducible and scalable benchmark for realworld trained robot manipulation policies addressing a critical missing capability in todays robotics landscape audio autoencoders learn useful compressed audio representations but their nonlinear latent spaces prevent intuitive algebraic manipulation such as mixing or scaling we introduce a ple training methodology to induce linearity in a highcompression consistency autoencoder cae by using data augmentation thereby inducing homogeneity equivariance to scalar gain and additivity the decoder preserves addition without altering the models architecture or loss function when trained with our method the cae exhibits linear behavior in both the encoder and decoder while preserving reconstruction fidelity we test the practical utility of our learned space on music source composition and separation via ple latent arithmetic this work presents a straightforward technique for constructing structured latent spaces enabling more intuitive and efficient audio processing fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups with applications spanning community detection team formation resource allocation and social network analysis many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints or rely on multistage pipelines eg spectral embedding followed by kmeans limiting tradeoff control interpretability and scalability we introduce dfnmf an endtoend deep nonnegative trifactorization tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft statisticalparity regularizer a single parameter lambda tunes the fairnessutility balance while nonnegativity yields partsbased factors and transparent soft memberships the optimization uses sparsefriendly alternating updates and scales nearlinearly with the number of edges across synthetic and real networks dfnmf achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable modularity often dominating stateoftheart baselines on the pareto front the code is available at exploiting lowprecision computations has become a standard strategy in deep learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger models and datasets however naively performing all computations in low precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities therefore mixed precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use lowprecision computations only for whitelisted operations despite their success these principles are currently not reliable for training continuoustime architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations neural odes this paper presents a mixed precision training framework for neural odes combining explicit ode solvers with a custom backpropagation scheme and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks our scheme uses lowprecision computations for evaluating the velocity parameterized by the neural network and for storing intermediate states while stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating the solution and gradients in higher precision these contributions address two key challenges in training neural ode the computational cost of repeated network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of time steps or layers along with the paper we publish our extendable opensource pytorch package rampde whose syntax resembles that of leading packages to provide a dropin replacement in existing codes we demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on neural ode applications in image classification and generative models achieving imately memory reduction and up to speedup while maintaining accuracy comparable to singleprecision training recent large visionlanguage models lvlms can generate visiontext multimodal chainofthought mcot traces after reinforcement finetuning rft however we observe that the visual information incorporated in mcot is often inaccurate though still yield correct answers indicating a lack of faithfulness in the mcot reasoning process we attribute this unfaithfulness to the rl reward in rft which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved visiontext cues ie it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information in this paper we first probe the faithfulness of mcot by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened surprisingly the models predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored to further analyze visual information we introduce an automated lvlmbased evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives reliability and sufficiency our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current mcot traces is ultaneously unreliable and insufficient to address this issue we propose a novel mcot learning strategy termed sufficientcomponent cause model sccm learning this approach encourages the mcot to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers we note that the proposed sccm is annotationfree and compatible with various rft for mcot in a plugandplay manner empirical results demonstrate that sccm consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of finegrained perception and reasoning benchmarks code is available at chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip the use of blackbox optimization bbo for chip placement has a history of several decades however early efforts were limited by immature problem formulations and inefficient algorithm designs recent progress has shown the effectiveness and efficiency of bbo for chip placement proving its potential to achieve stateoftheart results despite these advancements the field lacks a unified bbospecific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various problem formulations and bbo algorithms to fill this gap we propose bboplacebench the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and developing bbo algorithms for chip placement tasks it integrates three problem formulations of bbo for chip placement and offers a modular decoupled and flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement test and compare their own algorithms bboplacebench integrates a wide variety of existing bbo algorithms including ulated annealing sa evolutionary algorithms eas and bayesian optimization bo experimental results show that the problem formulations of maskguided optimization and hyperparameter optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem formulation while eas demonstrate better overall performance than sa and bo especially in highdimensional search spaces and also achieve stateoftheart performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods bboplacebench not only facilitates the development of efficient bbodriven solutions for chip placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios which are urgently needed for the bbo community the code of bboplacebench is available at calibration has emerged as a foundational goal in trustworthy machine learning in part because of its strong decision theoretic semantics independent of the underlying distribution and independent of the decision makers utility function calibration promises that amongst all policies mapping predictions to actions the uniformly best policy is the one that trusts the predictions and acts as if they were correct but this is true only of fully calibrated forecasts which are tractable to guarantee only for very low dimensional prediction problems for higher dimensional prediction problems eg when outcomes are multiclass weaker forms of calibration have been studied that lack these decision theoretic properties in this paper we study how a conservative decision maker should map predictions endowed with these weaker partial calibration guarantees to actions in a way that is robust in a minimax sense ie to maximize their expected utility in the worst case over distributions consistent with the calibration guarantees we characterize their minimax optimal decision rule via a duality argument and show that surprisingly trusting the predictions and acting accordingly is recovered in this minimax sense by decision calibration and any strictly stronger notion of calibration a substantially weaker and more tractable condition than full calibration for calibration guarantees that fall short of decision calibration the minimax optimal decision rule is still efficiently computable and we provide an empirical evaluation of a natural one that applies to any regression model solved to optimize squared error financial narratives from us securities and exchange commission sec filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts ects are very important for investors auditors and regulators however their length financial jargon and nuanced language make finegrained analysis difficult prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large expensive labeled dataset making the sentencelevel stance towards specific financial targets challenging in this work we introduce a sentencelevel corpus for stance detection focused on three core financial metrics debt earnings per share eps and sales the sentences were extracted from form annual reports and ects and labeled for stance positive negative neutral using the advanced chatgptopro model under rigorous human validation using this corpus we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models llms using zeroshot fewshot and chainofthought cot prompting strategies our results show that fewshot with cot prompting performs best compared to supervised baselines and llms performance varies across the sec and ect datasets our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging llms for targetspecific stance in the financial domain without requiring extensive labeled data confidence in llms is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer reliability existing work mainly focused on singleturn scenarios while research on confidence in complex multiturn interactions is limited in this paper we investigate whether llmbased search agents have the ability to communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after long sequences of actions a significantly more challenging task compared to outputting confidence in a single interaction experimenting on opensource agentic models we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at high confidence while having nearzero accuracy when confidence is low based on this observation we propose testtime scaling tts methods that use confidence scores to determine answer quality encourage the model to try again until reaching a satisfactory confidence level results show that our proposed methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive performance compared to baseline fixed budget tts methods reward models rms play a critical role in aligning ai behaviors with human preferences yet they face two fundamental challenges modality imbalance where most rms are mainly focused on text and image modalities offering limited support for video audio and other modalities and preference rigidity where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the complexity and diversity of personalized preferences to address the above challenges we propose omnireward a step toward generalist omnimodal reward modeling with support for freeform preferences consisting of evaluation we introduce omnirewardbench the first omnimodal rm benchmark with freeform preferences covering nine tasks across five modalities including text image video audio and data we construct omnirewarddata a multimodal preference dataset comprising general preference pairs and instructiontuning pairs for training generalist omnimodal rms model we propose omnirewardmodel which includes both discriminative and generative rms and achieves strong performance on omnirewardbench as well as other widely used reward modeling benchmarks lowlight vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to severe illumination degradation which significantly affects the performance of downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation while recent stateoftheart methods have improved performance through invariant feature learning modules they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of lowlight conditions therefore we revisit lowlight image formation and extend the classical lambertian model to better characterize lowlight conditions by shifting our analysis to the frequency domain we theoretically prove that the frequencydomain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract illuminationinvariant features via a structured filtering process we then propose a novel and endtoend trainable module named frequencydomain radial basis network frbnet which integrates the frequencydomain channel ratio operation with a learnable frequency domain filter for the overall illuminationinvariant feature enhancement as a plugandplay module frbnet can be integrated into existing networks for lowlight downstream tasks without modifying loss functions extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that frbnet achieves superior performance including map for dark object detection and miou for nighttime segmentation code is available at the rapid ascent of foundation models fms enabled by the transformer architecture drives the current ai ecosystem characterized by largescale training and downstream adaptability fms as gpt family have achieved massive public adoption fueling a turbulent market shaped by platform economics and intense investment assessing the vulnerability of this fastevolving industry is critical yet challenging due to data limitations this paper proposes a synthetic ai vulnerability index aivi focusing on the upstream value chain for fm production prioritizing publicly available data we model fm output as a function of five inputs compute data talent capital and energy hypothesizing that supply vulnerability in any input threatens the industry key vulnerabilities include compute concentration data scarcity and legal risks talent bottlenecks capital intensity and strategic dependencies as well as escalating energy demands acknowledging imperfect input substitutability we propose a weighted geometrical average of aggregate subindexes normalized using theoretical or empirical benchmarks despite limitations and room for improvement this preliminary index aims to quantify systemic risks in ais core production engine and implicitly shed a light on the risks for downstream value chain data valuation has become central in the era of datacentric ai it drives efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by assigning a numeric value to each data point most existing data valuation methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating changes in model validation performance under indistribution id settings as opposed to outofdistribution ood scenarios where data follow different patterns since id and ood data behave differently data valuation methods based on id loss often fail to generalize to ood settings particularly when the validation set contains no ood data furthermore although oodaware methods exist they involve heavy computational costs which hinder practical deployment to address these challenges we introduce eigenvalue ev a plugandplay data valuation framework for ood robustness that uses only an id data subset including during validation ev provides a new spectral imation of domain discrepancy which is the gap of loss between id and ood using ratios of eigenvalues of id datas covariance matrix ev then estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via perturbation theory alleviating the computational burden subsequently ev plugs into id lossbased methods by adding an ev term without any additional training loop we demonstrate that ev achieves improved ood robustness and stable value rankings across realworld datasets while remaining computationally lightweight these results indicate that ev is practical for largescale settings with domain shift offering an efficient path to oodrobust data valuation the immense success of the transformer architecture in natural language processing has led to its adoption in time se ries forecasting tsf where superior performance has been shown however a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by demonstrating that a ple single layer linear model outperforms transformerbased models this was soon shown to be not as valid by a better transformerbased model termed patchtst more re cently timellm demonstrated even better results by repurposing a large language model llm for the tsf domain again a follow up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the llm component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields better performance one of the challenges in forecasting is the fact that tsf data favors the more recent past and is sometimes subject to unpredictable events based upon these recent insights in tsf we propose a strong mixture of experts moe framework our method combines the stateoftheart sota models including xlstm en hanced linear patchtst and mingru among others this set of complimentary and diverse models for tsf are integrated in a trans former based moe gating network our proposed model outperforms all existing tsf models on standard benchmarks surpassing even the latest approaches based on moe frameworks religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse even in ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change debates this paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious language appear in climaterelated texts produced by secular and religious nongovernmental organizations ngos we introduce a dual methodological approach a rulebased model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms derived from ecotheology literature and large language models llms operating in a zeroshot setting using a dataset of more than sentences we compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of agreement and divergence the results show that the rulebased method consistently labels more sentences as religious than llms these findings highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning this study contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred persists in climate discourse we investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data generators meeting formal correctness criteria in symbolic neural generators sngs symbolic learners examine logical specifications of feasible data from a small set of instances sometimes just one each specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a neuralbased generator which rejects any instance violating the symbolic specification like other neurosymbolic approaches sng exploits the complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods the outcome of an sng is a triple where is a symbolic description of feasible instances constructed from data a set of generated new instances that satisfy the description and an associated weight we introduce a semantics for such systems based on the construction of appropriate base and fibre partiallyordered sets combined into an overall partial order and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications in this extension sngs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering we implement an sng combining a restricted form of inductive logic programming ilp with a large language model llm and evaluate it on earlystage drug design our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor molecules generated by the sng on benchmark problems where drug targets are well understood sng performance is statistically comparable to stateoftheart methods on exploratory problems with poorly understood targets generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading clinical candidates experts further find the symbolic specifications

further the thesis explores the current state of selfsupervised learning in medical imaging it introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data significantly advancing the models interpretative abilities this approach is validated through rigorous experimentation including the use of the medmnist dataset demonstrating the models proficiency in learning generalized features applicable to various downstream tasks in summary this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image analysis by offering a scalable adaptable framework that reduces reliance on labeled data it paves the way for more accurate efficient diagnostic tools in healthcare signifying a major step forward in the application of deep learning in medical imaging the performance of artificial intelligence ai systems fundamentally depends on highquality training data however lowresource languages like arabic suffer from severe data scarcity moreover the absence of childspecific speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges to address this gap we present our created dataset arabic little stt a dataset of levantine arabic child speech recorded in classrooms containing utterances from children ages we further conduct a systematic assessment of whisper a stateoftheart automatic speech recognition asr model on this dataset and compare its performance with adult arabic benchmarks our evaluation across eight whisper variants reveals that even the bestperforming model largev struggles significantly achieving a word error rate wer on child speech starkly contrasting with its sub wer on adult datasets these results align with other research on english speech results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and inclusive training data in asr development asizing that such data must be governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child information we hope that this study provides an initial step for future work on equitable speech technologies for arabicspeaking children we hope that our publicly available dataset enrich the childrens demographic representation in asr datasets existing multiview object reconstruction methods heavily rely on sufficient overlap between input views where occlusions and sparse coverage in practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness recent advancements in diffusionbased generative techniques offer the potential to address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to hallucinate invisible parts of objects thereby generating plausible structures however the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the accuracy and reliability of generation results preventing existing reconstruction frameworks from integrating such generative priors in this work we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusionbased generative methods fail to achieve high consistency including a the insufficiency in constructing and leveraging crossview connections when extracting multiview image features as conditions and the poor controllability of iterative denoising during local detail generation which easily leads to plausible but inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs accordingly we propose reconviagen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address these issues extensive experiments demonstrate that our reconviagen can reconstruct complete and accurate models consistent with input views in both global structure and local page accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous intrinsic signals eg sequence and structure with noisy extrinsic contexts eg proteinprotein interactions and go term annotations however two key challenges hinder effective fusion i crossmodal distributional mismatch among embeddings produced by pretrained intrinsic encoders and ii noisy relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade gnnbased information aggregation we propose diffused and aligned multimodal protein embedding dampe a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms first we propose optimal transport otbased representation alignment that establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different modalities effectively mitigating crossmodal heterogeneity second we develop a conditional graph generation cggbased information fusion method where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide informative cues for graph reconstruction meanwhile our theoretical analysis implies that the cgg objective drives this condition encoder to absorb graphaware knowledge into its produced protein representations empirically dampe outperforms or matches stateoftheart methods such as dpfunc on standard go benchmarks achieving aupr gains of pp and fmax gains pp ablation studies further show that otbased alignment contributes pp aupr while cggbased fusion adds pp fmax overall dampe offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for robust multimodal protein representation learning substantially enhancing protein function prediction circuit discovery which involves identifying sparse and taskrelevant subnetworks in pretrained language models is a cornerstone of mechanistic interpretability automated circuit discovery acdc has emerged as a pivotal methodology in circuit discovery but its application to large language models is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory requirements although several accelerated approaches have been proposed they primarily rely on linear imations to acdc which significantly compromises analytical faithfulness our proposed method for accelerating automated circuit discovery per attention head quantization pahq takes a fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each individual patching operation pahq leverages a fundamental alignment between activation patching and mixedprecision quantization mpq interpretability analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies therefore we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network pahqaccelerated acdc reduces runtime by up to and memory consumption by up to compared to unaccelerated acdc while maintaining faithfulness importantly our method readily integrates with existing edgebased circuit discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism this trainingfree approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating mechanistic interpretability methods our code is available at autonomous robotic navigation in realworld environments requires exploration to acquire environmental information as well as goaldirected navigation in order to reach specified targets active inference aif based on the freeenergy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by minimizing the expected free energy efe thereby combining epistemic and extrinsic values to realize this practically we propose a deep aif framework that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale recurrent statespace model mtrssm as the world model the diffusion policy generates diverse candidate actions while the mtrssm predicts their longhorizon consequences through latent imagination enabling action selection that minimizes efe realworld navigation experiments demonstrated that our framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the baselines particularly in explorationdemanding scenarios these results highlight how aif based on efe minimization can unify exploration and goaldirected navigation in realworld robotic settings in this work we introduce progressive growing of patch size an automatic curriculum learning approach for medical image segmentation our approach progressively increases the patch size during model training resulting in an improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of the training process we evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings a resourceefficient mode and a performance mode both regarding dice score performance and computational costs across diverse and popular medical image segmentation tasks the resourceefficient mode matches the dice score performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a notable reduction in training time to only the performance mode improves upon constant patch size segmentation results achieving a statistically significant relative mean performance gain of in dice score remarkably across all tasks our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the constant patch size baseline in dice score performance while ultaneously reducing training time to only the benefits are particularly pronounced for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks rigorous experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance yielding more trustworthy model comparison furthermore our findings reveal that the proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance across diverse segmentation models including unet unetr and swinunetr in summary we show that this ple yet elegant transformation on input data substantially improves both dice score performance and training runtime while being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones automating radiology report generation with large visionlanguage models lvlms holds great potential yet these models often produce clinically critical hallucinations posing serious risks existing hallucination detection methods frequently lack the necessary sentencelevel granularity or robust generalization across different lvlm generators we introduce a novel approach a sentencelevel process reward model prm adapted for this visionlanguage task our prm predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence conditioned on clinical context and preceding text when finetuned on mimiccxr with weaklysupervised labels a lightweight bparameter prm outperforms existing verification techniques demonstrating for instance relative improvements of in matthews correlation coefficient and in auroc over strong whitebox baselines on outputs from one lvlm unlike methods reliant on internal model states our prm demonstrates strong generalization to an unseen lvlm we further show its practical utility prm scores effectively filter lowquality reports improving fchexbert scores by when discarding the worst of reports moreover when guiding a novel weighted bestofn selection process on the mimiccxr test set our prm show relative improvements in clinical metrics of for fchexbert and for bertscore these results demonstrate that a lightweight contextaware prm provides a modelagnostic safety layer for clinical lvlms without access to internal activations eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific disciplines with the recent surge and development of machine learning neural eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to traditional solvers however a key limitation is the requirement for large amounts of labeled data in training including operators and their eigenvalues to tackle this limitation we propose a novel method named sorting chebyshev subspace filter scsf which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data generation by leveraging ilarities between operators a factor overlooked by existing methods specifically scsf employs truncated fast fourier transform sorting to group operators with ilar eigenvalue distributions and constructs a chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones reducing redundant computations to the best of our knowledge scsf is the first method to accelerate eigenvalue data generation experimental results show that scsf achieves up to a times speedup compared to various numerical solvers large language models llms have shown impressive promise in code generation yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of largescale datasets that are both diverse and wellaligned with human reasoning most existing resources pair problems with solutions but omit the intermediate thought process that guides coding to close this gap we present a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly instructionreasoningcodetest quadruplets each sample combines a task a stepbystep reasoning trace a working solution and executable tests enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving our pipeline combines four key components curated contest problems webmined content filtered by

between reasoning traces and code implementations our key finding is that finetuning llms on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding benchmarks beyond raw accuracy reasoningaware data can substitute for model scaling generalize across architectures and outperform leading opensource alternatives under identical sample budgets our work establishes reasoningcentered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for advancing coding capabilities in llms we publish our dataset and generation pipeline to facilitate further research continual pretraining cpt for domain

adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting constraints under compute limits relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug drug interactions and predicting side effects the advancement of machine learning methods in relation extraction along with the development of large medical text databases has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge however to the best of our knowledge there are limited datasets specifically designed for drug drug relation extraction currently available therefore employing transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this domain in this study we propose dream a method that first employs a trained relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of drug relationships the extracted relations are subsequently validated using a large language model quantitative results indicate that the llm agreed with of the relations extracted from a subset of pubmed abstracts furthermore our qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in the medical domain highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction in this field the screenplay serves as the foundation for television production defining narrative structure character development and dialogue while large language models llms show great potential in creative writing direct endtoend generation approaches often fail to produce wellcrafted screenplays we argue this failure stems from forcing a single model to ultaneously master two disparate capabilities creative narrative construction and rigid format adherence the resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use to enable llms to generate highquality screenplays we introduce dualstage refinement dsr a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative generation from format conversion the first stage transforms a brief outline into rich novelstyle prose the second stage refines this narrative into a professionally formatted screenplay this separation enables the model to specialize in one distinct capability at each stage a key challenge in implementing dsr is the scarcity of paired outlinetonovel training data we address this through hybrid data synthesis reverse synthesis deconstructs existing screenplays into structured inputs while forward synthesis leverages these inputs to generate highquality narrative texts as training targets blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that dsr achieves a win rate against strong baselines like geminipro and reaches of humanlevel performance our work demonstrates that decomposed generation architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes llms in complex creative domains the growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in nonintrusive sensing methods like vibrationbased gesture recognition while prior studies demonstrated feasibility they often rely on complex preprocessing and large neural networks nns requiring costly highperformance hardware resulting in high energy usage and limited realworld deployability this study proposes an energyefficient solution deploying compact nns on lowpower fieldprogrammable gate arrays fpgas to enable realtime gesture recognition with competitive accuracy we adopt a series of optimizations we replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input eliminating complex onboard preprocessing while reducing input size by without sacrificing accuracy we design two lightweight architectures dcnn and dsepcnn tailored for embedded fpgas reducing parameters from million to as few as while maintaining comparable accuracy with integeronly quantization and automated rtl generation we achieve seamless fpga deployment a pingpong buffering mechanism in dsepcnn further improves deployability under tight memory constraints we extend a hardwareaware search framework to support constraintdriven model configuration selection considering accuracy deployability latency and energy consumption evaluated on two swipedirection datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables our approach achieves lowlatency energyefficient inference on the amd spartan xcs fpga under the ps data splitting setting the selected bit dcnn reaches average accuracy across users with ms latency the chosen bit dsepcnn further reduces latency to ms over cpu speedup with slightly lower accuracy both consume under mj per inference demonstrating suitability for longterm edge operation deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require understanding both vision and language conventional architectures typically isolate perception for example cnnbased visual encoders from decisionmaking policy networks this separation can be inefficient since the policys failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is important to address this we implement the perceptiondecision interleaving transformer pdit architecture introduced by mao et al a model that alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer this interleaving allows feedback from decisionmaking to refine perceptual features dynamically in addition we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by clip to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features we evaluate the pdit encoders on the babyai gotolocal environment and find that the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a standard ppo baseline the results suggest that interleaved transformer encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous agents we provide a new perspective on gspos lengthnormalized importance ratios by establishing their connection to informationtheoretic quantities we show that gspos sequencelevel weight stheta pithetapithetatextoldy can be equivalently expressed as the inverse perplexity ratio textpplthetatextoldtextppltheta and as the exponential crossentropy change expdelta while the perplexityentropy relationship follows from standard definitions this observation provides a useful lens for understanding gspo the algorithm weights policy gradient updates by perplexity ratios offering an informationtheoretic interpretation of the importance weights this perspective helps explain gspos empirical properties including logdomain variance reduction through geometric averaging and stability in training mixtureofexperts models we validate the mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks recent advances in financespecific language models such as finbert have enabled the quantification of public sentiment into indexbased measures yet compressing diverse linguistic signals into single metrics overlooks contextual nuances and limits interpretability to address this limitation explainable ai techniques particularly shap shapley additive explanations have been employed to identify influential features however shaps computational cost grows exponentially with input features making it impractical for largescale textbased financial data this study introduces a grubased forecasting framework enhanced with groupshap which quantifies contributions of semantically related keyword groups rather than individual tokens substantially reducing computational burden while preserving interpretability we employed finbert to embed news articles from to clustered them into coherent semantic groups and applied groupshap to measure each groups contribution to stock price movements the resulting grouplevel shap variables across multiple topics were used as input features for the prediction model empirical results from onedayahead forecasting of the sp index throughout demonstrate that our approach achieves a reduction in mae and a reduction in rmse compared with benchmark models without the groupshap mechanism this research presents the first application of groupshap in newsdriven financial forecasting showing that grouped sentiment representations ultaneously enhance interpretability and predictive performance medical multidocument summarization mds is a complex task that requires effectively managing crossdocument relationships this paper investigates whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of mds can improve a models ability to organize and contextualize information across documents compared to traditional flat summarization methods we investigate two ways of incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models llms and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using automated metrics modelbased metrics and domain expert evaluation of preference understandability clarity complexity relevance coverage factuality and coherence our results show that human experts prefer modelgenerated summaries over humanwritten summaries hierarchical approaches generally preserve factuality coverage and coherence of information while also increasing human preference for summaries additionally we examine whether ulated judgments from gpt align with human judgments finding higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets our findings demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage providing a practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries the core task of recommender systems is to learn user preferences from historical useritem interactions with the rapid development of large language models llms recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning capabilities of llms to enhance rating prediction tasks however existing distillationbased methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher models insufficient recommendation capability costly and static supervision and superficial transfer of reasoning ability to address these issues this paper proposes reczero a reinforcement learning rlbased recommendation paradigm that abandons the traditional multimodel and multistage distillation approach instead reczero trains a single llm through pure rl to autonomously develop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction reczero consists of two key components thinkbeforerecommendation prompt construction which employs a structured reasoning template to guide the model in stepwise analysis of user interests item features and useritem compatibility and rulebased reward modeling which adopts group relative policy optimization grpo to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the llm additionally the paper explores a hybrid paradigm recone which combines supervised finetuning with rl initializing the model with coldstart reasoning samples and further optimizing it with rl experimental results demonstrate that reczero and recone significantly outperform existing baseline methods on multiple benchmark datasets validating the superiority of the rl paradigm in achieving autonomous reasoningenhanced recommender systems multilingual retrievalaugmented generation mrag often retrieves english documents and translates them into the query language for lowresource settings however poor translation quality degrades response generation performance existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality or utilize the rewriting method which introduces factual distortion and hallucinations to mitigate these problems we propose qualityaware translation tagging in mrag qttrag which explicitly evaluates translation quality along three dimensionssemantic equivalence grammatical accuracy and naturalnessfluencyand attach these scores as metadata without altering the original content we evaluate qttrag against crossrag and dkmrag as baselines in two opendomain qa benchmarks xorqa mkqa using six instructiontuned llms ranging from to parameters covering two lowresource languages korean and finnish and one highresource language chinese qttrag outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability this approach allows for effective usage of crosslingual documents in lowresource settings with limited native language documents offering a practical and robust solution across multilingual domains this note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient optimization for the passk objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards direct reinforcestyle methods and advantageshaping techniques that directly modify grpo we show that these are two sides of the same coin by reverseengineering existing advantageshaping algorithms we reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards we specifically interpret practical hardexample upweighting modifications to grpo as rewardlevel regularization conversely starting from surrogate reward objectives we provide a ple recipe for deriving both existing and new advantageshaping methods this perspective provides a lens for rlvr policy gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of passk recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in designing novel periodic crystal structures existing approaches typically rely on either large language models llms or equivariant denoising models each with complementary strengths llms excel at handling discrete atomic types but often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice parameters while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic compositions to bridge this gap we propose crysllmgen a hybrid framework that integrates an llm with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary strengths for crystal material generation during sampling crysllmgen first employs a finetuned llm to produce an intermediate representation of atom types atomic coordinates and lattice structure while retaining the predicted atom types it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a pretrained equivariant diffusion model for refinement our framework outperforms stateoftheart generative models across several benchmark tasks and datasets specifically crysllmgen not only achieves a balanced performance in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more stable and novel materials compared to llmbased and denoisingbased models furthermore crysllmgen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities effectively producing materials that satisfy userdefined constraints code is available at large language models llms are widely used as judges to evaluate response quality providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation however most llm judges operate solely on intrinsic textbased reasoning limiting their ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation motivated by the success of toolintegrated reasoning tir in numerous tasks we propose tirjudge an endtoend rl framework for training llm judges that integrates a code executor for precise evaluation tirjudge is built on three principles i diverse training across verifiable and nonverifiable domains ii flexible judgment formats pointwise pairwise listwise and iii iterative rl that bootstraps directly from the initial model without distillation on seven public benchmarks tirjudge surpasses strong reasoningbased judges by up to pointwise and pairwise and achieves listwise performance comparable to claudeopus despite having only parameters remarkably tirjudgezero trained entirely without distilled judge trajectories matches the performance of distilled variants demonstrating that toolaugmented judges can selfevolve through iterative reinforcement learning linguistic steganography enables covert communication through embedding secret messages into innocuous texts however current methods face critical limitations in payload capacity and security traditional modificationbased methods introduce detectable anomalies while retrievalbased strategies suffer from low embedding capacity modern generative steganography leverages language models to generate natural stego text but struggles with limited entropy in token predictions further constraining capacity to address these issues we propose an entropydriven framework called rtmstega that integrates rankbased adaptive coding and contextaware decompression with normalized entropy by mapping secret messages to token probability ranks and dynamically adjusting sampling via contextaware entropybased adjustments rtmstega achieves a balance between payload capacity and imperceptibility experiments across diverse datasets and models demonstrate that rtmstega triples the payload capacity of mainstream generative steganography reduces processing time by over and maintains high text quality offering a trustworthy solution for secure and efficient covert communication binarized neural networks bnns are a class of deep neural networks designed to utilize minimal computational resources which drives their popularity across various applications recent studies highlight the potential of mapping bnn model parameters onto emerging nonvolatile memory technologies specifically using crossbar architectures resulting in improved inference performance compared to traditional cmos implementations however the common practice of protecting model parameters from theft attacks by storing them in an encrypted format and decrypting them at runtime introduces significant computational overhead thus undermining the core principles of inmemory computing which aim to integrate computation and storage this paper presents a robust strategy for protecting bnn model parameters particularly within inmemory computing frameworks our method utilizes a secret key derived from a physical unclonable function to transform model parameters prior to storage in the crossbar subsequently the inference operations are performed on the encrypted weights achieving a very special case of fully homomorphic encryption fhe with minimal runtime overhead our analysis reveals that inference conducted without the secret key results in drastically diminished performance with accuracy falling below these results validate the effectiveness of our protection strategy in securing bnns within inmemory computing architectures while preserving computational efficiency autoregressive ar models have demonstrated competitive performance in image generation achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models however their tokenbytoken image generation mechanism remains computationally intensive and existing solutions such as var often lead to limited sample diversity in this work we propose a nested autoregressivenestar model which proposes nested autoregressive architectures in generating images nestar designs multiscale modules in a hierarchical order these different scaled modules are constructed in an ar architecture where one largerscale module is conditioned on outputs from its previous smallerscale module within each module nestar uses another ar structure to generate patches of tokens the proposed nested ar architecture reduces the overall complexity from mathcalon to mathcalolog in generating image tokens as well as increases image diversities nestar further incorporates flow matching loss to use continuous tokens and develops objectives to coordinate these multiscale modules in model training nestar achieves competitive image generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost fewshot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over relations given only a limited number of training examples while existing approaches largely adopt a metalearning framework for enabling fast adaptation to new relations they suffer from two key pitfalls first they learn relation metaknowledge in isolation failing to capture common relational patterns shared across tasks second they struggle to effectively incorporate local taskspecific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation to address these limitations we propose moemeta a novel metalearning framework that disentangles globally shared knowledge from taskspecific contexts to enable both effective generalization and rapid adaptation moemeta introduces two key innovations i a mixtureofexperts moe model that learns globally shared relational prototypes to enhance generalization and ii a tasktailored adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast taskspecific adaptation by balancing global generalization with local adaptability moemeta significantly advances fewshot relational learning extensive experiments and analyses on three kg benchmarks demonstrate that moemeta consistently outperforms existing baselines achieving stateoftheart performance the softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and optimization used in classification attention mechanisms reinforcement learning game theory and problems involving logsumexp terms existing robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a lipschitz constant of with respect to the ell norm in this work we prove that the softmax function is contractive with the lipschitz constant uniformly across all ellp norms with ge we also show that the local lipschitz constant of softmax attains for and infty and for in infty the constant remains strictly below and the supremum is achieved only in the limit to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive normuniform analysis of softmax lipschitz continuity we demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing theoretical results on robustness and convergence we further validate the sharpness of the lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through empirical studies on attentionbased architectures vit gpt qwenb and on stochastic policies in reinforcement learning we perform indepth evaluations of incontext learning icl on stateoftheart transformer statespace and hybrid large language models over two categories of knowledgebased icl tasks using a combination of behavioral probing and interventionbased methods we have discovered that while llms of different architectures can behave ilarly in task performance their internals could remain different we discover that function vectors fvs responsible for icl are primarily located in the selfattention and mamba layers and speculate that mamba uses a different mechanism from fvs to perform icl fvs are more important for icl involving parametric knowledge retrieval but not for contextual knowledge understanding our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types methodologically our approach also highlights the importance of combining both behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate llm capabilities ultrasound imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities offering realtime radiationfree assessment across diverse clinical domains however interpretation of ultrasound images remains challenging due to high noise levels operator dependence and limited field of view resulting in substantial interobserver variability current deep learning approaches are hindered by the scarcity of large labeled datasets and the domain gap between general and sonographic images which limits the transferability of models pretrained on nonmedical data to address these challenges we introduce the ultrasound selfsupervised foundation model with masked autoencoding usfmae the first largescale selfsupervised mae framework pretrained exclusively on ultrasound data the model was pretrained on and ultrasound images curated from opensource datasets collectively termed openus spanning over twenty anatomical regions this curated dataset has been made publicly available to facilitate further research and reproducibility using a vision transformer encoderdecoder architecture usfmae reconstructs masked image patches enabling it to learn rich modalityspecific representations directly from unlabeled data the pretrained encoder was finetuned on three public downstream classification benchmarks busbra breast cancer mmotud ovarian tumors and gistdb gastrointestinal stromal tumors across all tasks usfmae consistently outperformed conventional cnn and vit baselines achieving fscores of and respectively despite not using labels during pretraining usfmae approached the performance of the supervised foundation model ultrasam on breast cancer classification and surpassed it on the other tasks demonstrating strong crossanatomical generalization enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models llms is a key strategy for building agents that think then act however recent observations like openais suggest a paradox stronger reasoning often coincides with increased hallucination yet no prior work has systematically examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination to address this gap we pose the central question does strengthening reasoning increase tool hallucination to answer this we introduce pletoolhallubench a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes i no tool available and ii only distractor tools available through controlled experiments we establish three key findings first we demonstrate a causal relationship progressively enhancing reasoning through rl increases tool hallucination proportionally with task performance gains second this effect transcends overfitting training on nontool tasks eg mathematics still amplifies subsequent tool hallucination third the effect is methodagnostic appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised finetuning and when it is merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to stepbystep thinking we also evaluate mitigation strategies including prompt engineering and direct preference optimization dpo revealing a fundamental reliabilitycapability tradeoff reducing hallucination consistently degrades utility mechanistically reasoning rl disproportionately collapses toolreliabilityrelated representations and hallucinations surface as amplified divergences concentrated in latelayer residual streams these findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify tool hallucination highlighting the need for new training objectives that jointly optimize for capability and reliability objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent challenge in education while large language models llms offer potential generalpurpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex authentic classroom observation instruments this paper uses custom llms built on sentencelevel embeddings an architecture better suited for the longform interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword tokenization we systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings under a dataefficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting our results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve humanlevel and even superhuman performance with expert human ratings above and surpassing the average humanhuman rater correlation further through analysis of annotation context windows we find that more advanced modelsthose better aligned with human judgmentsattribute a larger share of score variation to lessonlevel features rather than isolated utterances challenging the sufficiency of singleturn annotation paradigms finally to assess external validity we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher valueadded measures indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning however this trend does not hold at the individual item level suggesting that while the models learn useful signals they have not yet achieved full generalization this work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for aidriven instructional measurement offering a path toward providing scalable reliable and valid feedback for educator development the widespread adoption of large language models llms raises critical concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs especially in highrisk domains such as biomedicine law and education existing evaluation methods for short texts often fail on longform content due to complex reasoning chains intertwined perspectives and cumulative information to address this we propose a systematic approach integrating largescale longform datasets multiagent verification mechanisms and weighted evaluation metrics we construct longhalluqa a chinese longform factuality dataset and develop madfact a debatebased multiagent verification system we introduce a fact importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in longform texts experiments on two benchmarks show that larger llms generally maintain higher factual consistency while domestic models excel on chinese content our work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual reliability in longform llm outputs guiding their safe deployment in sensitive domains llmpowered agents often use prompt compression to reduce inference costs but this introduces a new security risk compression modules which are optimized for efficiency rather than safety can be manipulated by adversarial inputs causing semantic drift and altering llm behavior this work identifies prompt compression as a novel attack surface and presents compressionattack the first framework to exploit it compressionattack includes two strategies hardcom which uses

critical concern existing studies predominantly concentrate on adversarial attacks or inherent flaws within the models however a more prevalent yet underexplored issue concerns how the quality of a benign but poorly formulated prompt affects the security of the generated code to investigate this we first propose an evaluation framework for prompt quality encompassing three key dimensions goal clarity information completeness and logical consistency based on this framework we construct and publicly release cwebenchpython a largescale benchmark dataset containing tasks with prompts

importance little attention has been given to establishing statistical reliability guarantees for llms under cl particularly in the setting of continual domain pretraining cdp conformal prediction cp has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for llms but it faces major challenges in cdp testing data often stems from unknown or shifting domain distributions under which cp may no longer provide valid guarantees moreover when high coverage is required cp can yield excessively large prediction sets for unanswerable queries reducing informativeness to address these challenges we introduce an adaptive rejection and nonexchangeable cp framework our method first estimates the distribution of questions across domains in the test set using transformerbased clustering then reweights or resamples the calibration data accordingly building on this adaptive rejection cp allows the llm to selectively abstain from answering when its confidence or competence shifts significantly extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability of cp under cdp scenarios our code is available at modeling openvocabulary language fields in is essential for intuitive humanai interaction and querying within physical environments stateoftheart approaches such as langsplat leverage gaussian splatting to efficiently construct these language fields encoding features distilled from highdimensional models like clip however this efficiency is currently offset by the requirement to train a scenespecific language autoencoder for feature compression introducing a costly perscene optimization bottleneck that hinders deployment scalability in this work we introduce genlangsplat that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scenewise autoencoder with a generalized autoencoder pretrained extensively on the largescale scannet dataset this architectural shift enables the use of a fixed compact latent space for language

misaligned local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model aggregation unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features across clients we consider a more general and realistic setting where each client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing input features within each modality to address the resulting misalignment in learned representations we propose a new federated learning framework featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable clientside embedding controls that encode each clients datamissing patterns these embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally aggregated representation with each clients local context enabling more effective use of shared information furthermore the embedding controls can be algorithmically aggregated across clients with ilar datamissing patterns to enhance

autoregressive approaches however prior diffusion models use a decoderonly architecture which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost our key insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation representing clean tokens and denoising corrupted tokens which enables us to use separate modules for each task we propose an encoderdecoder architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference which relies on an encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively refine a noised sequence we also show that this architecture enables faster training of block diffusion models which partition sequences into blocks for better quality and are commonly used in diffusion

commands requires translating highlevel instructions into feasible efficient multirobot plans while large language models llms combined with planning domain description language pddl offer promise for singlerobot scenarios existing approaches struggle with multirobot coordination due to brittle task decomposition poor scalability and low coordination efficiency we introduce pipllm a languagebased coordination framework that consists of pddlbased teamlevel planning and integer programming ip based robotlevel planning pipllms first decomposes the command by translating the command into a teamlevel pddl problem and solves it to obtain a teamlevel plan abstracting away robot assignment each teamlevel action represents a subtask to be finished by the team next this plan is translated into a dependency graph representing the subtasks dependency structure such a dependency graph is then used to guide the robotlevel planning in which each subtask node will be formulated as an ipbased task allocation problem explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot capabilities and userdefined constraints this separation of planning from assignment allows pipllm to avoid the pitfalls of syntaxbased decomposition and scale to larger teams experiments across diverse tasks show that pipllm improves plan success rate reduces maximum and average travel costs and achieves better load balancing compared to stateoftheart baselines incontext learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships shaping how large language models llms retrieve contextual information analogous to human episodic memory where the retrieval of specific events is enabled by separating events that happened at different times this work probes the ability of various pretrained llms including transformer and statespace models to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events specifically we prompted models with sequences containing multiple presentations of the same token which reappears at the sequence end by fixing the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others we removed semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on nexttoken prediction across diverse sequences models consistently placed the highest probabilities on tokens following a repeated token but with a notable bias for those nearest the beginning or end of the input an ablation experiment linked this phenomenon in transformers to induction heads extending the analysis to unique semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably despite architectural differences statespace and transformer models showed comparable temporal biases our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in incontext learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable temporal separation and episodic retrieval despite the widespread adoption of large language models llms their strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of highresource languages for which there is abundant training data recently continual pretraining cpt has

extends a single text embedding model to perform both highquality retrieval and listwise reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency by applying cosine ilarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified ranking function the listwise ranking prompt which is constructed from the original query

providing vehicles with the ability to accurately interpret their environment perception systems remain susceptible to errors caused by overlyconfident predictions in the case of rare events or outofsample data this study equips an autonomous vehicle with the ability to know when it is uncertain using an uncertaintyaware image classifier as part of the av software stack specifically the study exploits the ability of randomset neural networks rsnns to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty unlike traditional cnns or bayesian methods rsnns predict belief functions over sets of

models and advancing the semantic understanding of sar imagery the code and datasets will be released soon selfsupervised learning ssl has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations without labeled data most ssl approaches rely on strong wellestablished handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse views for representation learning however designing such augmentations requires domainspecific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational invariances on the model which can limit generalization in this work we propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames we show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete spaces reside on distinct manifolds shaped by the geometric biases introduced by representing samples in different spaces by jointly leveraging the complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds our approach achieves superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through strong augmentations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine datasets across five temporal sequence tasks where signalspecific characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging without relying on augmentationinduced diversity our method achieves performance gains of up to over existing selfsupervised approaches source code density estimation is essential for generative modeling particularly with the rise of modern neural networks while existing methods capture complex data distributions they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification bayesian nonparametric methods especially the polya tree offer a robust framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior over small intervals traditional techniques like markov chain monte carlo mcmc face high computational complexity and scalability limitations hindering the use of bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning to tackle this we introduce the variational polya tree vpt model which employs stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions this model provides a flexible nonparametric bayesian prior that captures latent densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization we also leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a

response generation but often face challenges of high computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding in this work we introduce an imitationlearningbased selfspeculative decoding ssd framework named fastvlm to address these limitations our approach employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive manner while a full model verifies these tokens nonautoregressively accepted tokens proceed seamlessly while rejected tokens are corrected by the full model and used to guide the draft models refinement through an imitation network fastvlm enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights from the full models architecture also it maintains the performance integrity of the full model while training the draft model achieving a

incorporating traditional linguistic methodology with ai this bridge between linguistic research with technological innovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for communitybased language revitalization this paper presents a realtime modular defense system named sentraguard the system detects and mitigates jailbreak and prompt injection attacks targeting large language models llms the framework uses a hybrid architecture with faissindexed sbert embedding representations that capture the semantic meaning of prompts combined with finetuned transformer classifiers which are machine learning models specialized for distinguishing between benign and adversarial language inputs it identifies adversarial prompts in both direct and obfuscated attack

is transparent finetunable and compatible with diverse llm backends its modular design supports scalable deployment in both commercial and opensource environments the system establishes a new stateoftheart in adversarial llm defense ai agents powered by large language models llms are being deployed at scale yet we lack a systematic understanding of how the choice of backbone llm affects agent security the nondeterministic sequential nature of ai agents complicates security modeling while the integration of traditional software with ai components entangles novel llm vulnerabilities with conventional security risks existing frameworks only partially address these challenges as they either capture specific vulnerabilities only or require modeling of complete agents to address these limitations we introduce threat snapshots a framework that isolates specific states in an agents execution flow where llm vulnerabilities manifest enabling the systematic identification and categorization of security risks that propagate from the llm to the agent level we apply this framework to construct the operatornameb benchmark a security benchmark based on unique crowdsourced adversarial attacks we then evaluate popular llms with it revealing among other insights that enhanced reasoning capabilities improve security while model size does not correlate with security we release our benchmark dataset and evaluation code to facilitate widespread adoption by llm providers and practitioners offering guidance for agent developers and incentivizing model developers to prioritize backbone security improvements pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding animal posture behavior and welfare yet agricultural applications remain

challenges to the usefulness and reliability of artificial intelligencegenerated code posthoc calibration of internal model confidences aims to align probabilities with an acceptability measure prior work suggests calibration can improve alignment but atscale evidence is limited in this work we investigate the feasibility of applying calibration of code models to an inide context we study two aspects of the problem the technical method for implementing confidence calibration and improving the reliability of code generation models and the humancentered design principles for effectively communicating reliability signal to developers first we develop a scalable and flexible calibration framework which can be used to obtain calibration weights for opensource models using any dataset and evaluate whether calibrators improve the alignment between model confidence and developer acceptance behavior through a largescale analysis of over million realworld developer interactions across multiple programming languages we find that a general posthoc calibration model based on plattscaling does not on average improve the reliability of model confidence signals we also find that while dynamically personalizing calibration to individual users can be effective its effectiveness is highly dependent on the volume of user interaction data second we conduct a multiphase design study with

companion observing interpreting and guiding health in real time across daily life by integrating personal sensing experiential computing and populationlevel analytics pcu promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a new substrate for public health and scientific discovery we describe the architecture design principles and implementation challenges of this emerging paradigm the reliability of ultaneous localization and mapping slam is severely constrained in environments where visual inputs suffer from noise and low illumination although recent gaussian splatting dgs based slam frameworks achieve highfidelity mapping under clean conditions they remain vulnerable to compounded degradations that degrade mapping and tracking performance a key observation underlying our work is that the original dgs rendering pipeline inherently behaves as an implicit lowpass filter attenuating highfrequency noise but also risking oversmoothing building on this insight we propose rogerslam a robust dgs slam system tailored for noise and lowlight resilience the framework integrates three innovations a structurepreserving robust fusion sprofusion mechanism that couples rendered

language models llms through reciprocal peer assessment this paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the autobench methodology originally developed as an opensource project by ezecute srl unlike static benchmarks that suffer from testset contamination and limited adaptability autobench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while models alternately serve as question generators contestants and judges across diverse domains an iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of consistently reliable evaluators aggregating peer judgments into consensusbased rankings that reflect collective model agreement our experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks including mmlupro and gpqa respectively and validating this peerdriven evaluation

asize the value of combining imagebased representations with explainable ai methods to improve both predictive accuracy and model transparency in toxicology object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects such as their positional states eg open or closed and functional states eg on or off while recent visionlanguage models vlms are capable of performing a variety of multimodal tasks it remains unclear how precisely they can identify object states to alleviate this issue we introduce the state and transition understanding benchmark status bench the first benchmark for rigorously evaluating the ability of vlms to understand subtle variations in object states in diverse situations specifically status bench introduces a novel evaluation scheme that requires vlms to perform three tasks ultaneously object state identification osi image retrieval ir and state change identification sci these tasks are defined over our fully handcrafted dataset involving image pairs their corresponding object state descriptions and state change descriptions furthermore we introduce a largescale training dataset namely status train which consists of million semiautomatically created descriptions this dataset serves as the largest resource to facilitate further research in this area in our experiments we demonstrate that status bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and reveal that current stateoftheart vlms still significantly struggle to capture subtle object state distinctions surprisingly under the proposed rigorous evaluation scheme most openweight vlms exhibited chancelevel zeroshot performance after finetuning on status train qwenvl achieved performance comparable to gemini flash these findings underscore the necessity of status bench and train for

performance and reliability of autonomous racing drones in increasingly complex and competitive scenarios blockchain systems rely on decentralized ledgers and strong security guarantees a key requirement is nonrepudiation which prevents denial of transaction authorship and supports integrity of recorded data this work surveys digital signature schemes used in blockchain platforms and analyzes how they deliver nonrepudiation and contribute to overall system security we examine representative scheme families and their cryptographic foundations security assumptions and properties relevant to deployment including unforgeability resistance to malleability support for aggregation and multisignature or threshold settings key and signature sizes and verification cost using these criteria we compare the suitability of different designs for consensus protocols smart contract constraints and resource limits we highlight practical tradeoffs that affect throughput storage scalability and attack surfaces and summarize benefits and limitations of each scheme in blockchain contexts the study underscores that carefully chosen digital signatures are central to achieving nonrepudiation and preserving information integrity and it outlines implementation considerations and open directions such as interoperability and postquantum readiness with recent technological advances process logs which were traditionally deterministic in nature are being captured from nondeterministic sources such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models that predict activities using cameras in the presence of stochasticallyknown logs logs that contain probabilistic information the need for stochastic trace recovery increases to offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems we design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery based on diffusion denoising probabilistic models ddpm which makes use of process knowledge either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting process knowledge in the training phase to recover traces by denoising we conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating stateoftheart performance with up to a improvement over existing methods along with increased robustness under high noise levels large language models llms are equipped with increasingly extended context windows recently yet their long context understanding capabilities over long dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored this gap is especially significant in many realworld longcontext applications that were rarely benchmarked in this paper we introduce loogle a novel benchmark designed to evaluate llms long context ability in realworld applications and scenarios our benchmark consists of automatically collected realworld long texts ranging from to tokens encompassing domains in law finance game and code accordingly we delicately design types of domainspecific longdependency tasks and generate qa instances with various diversity and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical needs we conduct a comprehensive assessment of locally deployed and apibased llms the evaluation results show that even the bestperforming model achieves only a overall score on our benchmark despite the extensive context windows popular llms are only capable of understanding a much shorter length of context than they claim to be revealing significant limitations in their ability to handle realworld tasks with long dependencies and highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical longcontext understanding large language models llms have transformed text understanding yet their adaptation to specialized legal domains remains constrained by the cost of full finetuning this study provides a systematic evaluation of fine tuning parameter efficient adaptation lora qlora and zeroshot prompting strategies for unfair clause detection in terms of service tos documents a key application in legal nlp we finetune bert and distilbert apply bit lowrank adaptation lora to models such as tinyllama llama bb and saullm and evaluate gpto and oversions in zeroshot settings experiments on the claudettetos benchmark and the multilingual scraper corpus show that full finetuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance while lorabased models provide competitive recall with up to lower memory cost these findings highlight practical design tradeoffs for efficient and domainadapted llms contributing open baselines for finetuning research in legal text processing large multimodal models lmms have achieved remarkable progress in generating photorealistic and promptaligned images but they often produce outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge especially when prompts involve finegrained attributes or timesensitive events conventional retrievalaugmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external information yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration to bridge this gap we introduce orig an agentic open multimodal retrievalaugmented framework for factual image generation fig a new task that requires both visual realism and factual grounding orig iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation to support systematic evaluation we build figeval a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual compositional and temporal dimensions experiments demonstrate that orig substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation signed graph neural networks sgnns are widely adopted to analyze complex patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links given the noisy nature of realworld connections the robustness of sgnn has also emerged as a pivotal research area under the supervision of empirical properties graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph representation learning however there remains a paucity of research investigating a robust sgnn with theoretical guidance inspired by the success of graph information bottleneck gib in information extraction we propose ridge a novel framework for robust si gned graph learning through joint denoising of graph inputs and supervision targets different from the basic gib we extend the gib theory with the capability of target space denoising as the coexistence of noise in both input and target spaces in instantiation ridge effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational imation we extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed graph datasets and the results show that ridge clearly improves the robustness of popular sgnn models under various levels of noise in this work we present transitive reinforcement learning trl a new value learning algorithm based on a divideandconquer paradigm trl is designed for offline goalconditioned reinforcement learning gcrl problems where the aim is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the smallest number of steps trl converts a triangle inequality structure present in gcrl into a practical divideandconquer value update rule this has several advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms compared to temporal difference td methods trl suffers less from bias accumulation as in principle it only requires olog recursions as opposed to ot in td learning to handle a lengtht trajectory unlike monte carlo methods trl suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming experimentally we show that trl achieves the best performance in highly challenging longhorizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline gcrl algorithms accurate diagnosis of parkinsons disease pd from mri remains challenging due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity most existing methods rely on conventional magnitudebased mri modalities such as tweighted images tw which are less sensitive to pd pathology than quantitative susceptibility mapping qsm a phasebased mri technique that quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei in this study we propose gatefusenet an adaptive multimodal fusion network that integrates qsm and tw images for pd diagnosis the core innovation lies in a gated fusion module that learns modalityspecific attention weights and channelwise gating vectors for selective feature modulation this hierarchical gating mechanism enhances roiaware features while suppressing irrelevant signals experimental results show that our method outperforms three existing stateoftheart approaches achieving accuracy and auc ablation studies further validate the contributions of roi guidance multimodal integration and fusion positioning gradcam visualizations confirm the models focus on clinically relevant pathological regions the source codes and pretrained models can be found at materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces while satisfying multiple often conflicting objectives we present llmguided evolution for materials design llema a unified framework that couples the scientific

synthesizability and multiobjective tradeoffs llema delivers a principled pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery code as artificial intelligence ai systems approach and surpass expert human performance across a broad range of tasks obtaining highquality human supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging our focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains unfortunately even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single narrow area and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced ai systems on such superhuman tasks however based on their narrow expertise humans may provide a weak signal ie a complementary label indicating an option that is incorrect for example a cardiologist could state that this is not related to cardiology even if they cannot identify the true disease based on this weak signal we propose a scalable oversight framework that enables us to evaluate frontier ai systems without the need to prepare the ground truth we derive an unbiased estimator of top accuracy from complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to match the variance of ordinary labels we further introduce two estimators to combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels we provide finitesample deviation guarantees for both complementaryonly and the mixed estimators empirically we show that we can evaluate the output of large language models without the ground truth if we have complementary labels we further show that we can train an ai system with such weak signals we show how we can design an agentic ai system automatically that can perform better with this partitioned human supervision our code is available at quantum imaginary time evolution qite algorithm is one of the most promising variational quantum algorithms vqas bridging the current era of noisy intermediatescale quantum devices and the future of fully faulttolerant quantum computing although practical demonstrations of qite and its potential advantages over the general vqa trained with vanilla gradient descent gd in certain tasks have been reported a firstprinciple theoretical understanding of qite remains limited here we aim to develop an analytic theory for the dynamics of qite first we show that qite can be interpreted as a form of a general vqa trained with quantum natural gradient descent qngd where the inverse quantum fisher information matrix serves as the learningrate tensor this equivalence is established not only at the level of gradient update rules but also through the action principle the variational principle can be directly connected to the geometric geodesic distance in the quantum fisher information metric up to an integration constant second for wide quantum neural networks we employ the quantum neural tangent kernel framework to construct an analytic model for qite we prove that qite always converges faster than gdbased vqa though this advantage is suppressed by the exponential growth of hilbert space dimension this helps explain certain experimental results in quantum computational chemistry our theory encompasses linear quadratic and more general loss functions we validate the analytic results through numerical ulations our findings establish a theoretical foundation for qite dynamics and provide analytic insights for the firstprinciple design of variational quantum algorithms knowledge distillation kd aims to train a lightweight student model by transferring knowledge from a large highcapacity teacher recent studies have shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve distillation performance however achieving such diversity typically requires multiple teacher networks leading to high computational costs in this work we propose a novel costefficient knowledge augmentation method for kd that generates diverse multiviews by attaching multiple branches to a single teacher to ensure meaningful semantic variation across multiviews we introduce two angular diversity objectives constrained interangle diversify loss which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving proximity to the original teacher output and intraangle diversify loss which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output the ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views along with the original teacher is distilled into the student we further theoretically demonstrate that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby reduce the upper bound of the ensembles expected loss leading to more effective distillation experimental results show that our method surpasses an existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations moreover the proposed method is compatible with other kd frameworks in a plugandplay fashion providing consistent improvements in generalization performance to combat the prohibitive communication costs of freeforall multiagent systems mas we introduce agentgspo a framework that directly optimizes for token economy using sequencelevel reinforcement learning agentgspo leverages the stable and memoryefficient group sequence policy optimization gspo algorithm to train agents on a communicationaware reward that explicitly penalizes verbosity across seven reasoning benchmarks agentgspo not only achieves new stateoftheart performance but does so with a fraction of the token consumption of existing methods by fostering emergent strategies like strategic silence our approach provides a practical blueprint for developing scalable and economically viable multiagent systems personaassigned large language models llms can adopt diverse roles enabling personalized and contextaware reasoning however even minor demographic perturbations in personas such as ple pronoun changes can alter reasoning trajectories leading to divergent sets of correct answers instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated we explore their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness we propose choir collaborative harmonization for inference robustness a testtime framework that harmonizes multiple personaconditioned reasoning signals into a unified prediction choir orchestrates a collaborative decoding process among counterfactual personas dynamically balancing agreement and divergence in their reasoning paths experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that choir consistently enhances performance across demographics model architectures scales and tasks without additional training improvements reach up to for individual demographic groups and on average across five demographics it remains effective even when base personas are suboptimal by reframing persona variation as a constructive signal choir provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable llm reasoning recent advancements in and generative models have expanded the capabilities of computer vision however generating highquality dynamic content from a single static image remains a significant challenge traditional methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately capturing dynamic geometry changes especially when considering variations in camera perspective to address this issue we propose dynaposed an innovative solution that integrates gaussian splatting dgs techniques with categoryagnostic pose estimation cape technology this framework uses gaussian splatting to construct a model from single images then predicts multiview pose keypoints based on oneshot support from a chosen view leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency experimental results show that dynaposed achieves excellent coherence consistency and fluidity in dynamic motion generation these findings not only validate the efficacy of the dynaposed framework but also indicate its potential applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production full finetuning of large language models llms is notoriously memoryintensive primarily because conventional optimizers such as sgd or adam assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations existing solutions either alter the model architecture eg reversible networks or trade memory for computation eg activation checkpointing but the optimizer itself remains untouched in this work we introduce gradlite a backwardfriendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively discarded or imated gradlite leverages two key techniques i lowrank jacobian imation which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated error signals and ii errorfeedback correction which accumulates and compensates imation errors across iterations to preserve convergence guarantees we provide a theoretical analysis showing that gradlite maintains unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance ensuring convergence rates comparable to adam empirically gradlite reduces optimizerstate and activation memory consumption by up to without architectural changes and achieves onpar or superior downstream performance on reasoning mmlu gsmk multilingual and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and optimizercentric baselines lomo galore multimodal large language models llms claim musical understanding via evaluations that conflate listening with score reading we benchmark three sota llms gemini pro gemini flash and qwenomni across three core music skills syncopation scoring transposition detection and chord quality identification moreover we separate three sources of variability i perceptual limitations audio vs midi inputs ii exposure to examples zero vs fewshot manipulations and iii reasoning strategies standalone cot logiclm for the latter we adapt logiclm a framework combining llms with symbolic solvers to perform structured reasoning to music results reveal a clear perceptual gap models perform near ceiling on midi but show accuracy drops on audio reasoning and fewshot prompting offer minimal gains this is expected for midi where performance reaches saturation but more surprising for audio where logiclm despite nearperfect midi accuracy remains notably brittle among models gemini pro achieves the highest performance across most conditions overall current systems reason well over symbols midi but do not yet listen reliably from audio our method and dataset make the perceptionreasoning boundary explicit and offer actionable guidance for building robust audiofirst music systems graph neural networks gnns have revolutionized the field of graph learning by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data as a common pattern to train powerful gnns the pretraining adaptation scheme first pretrains gnns over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to specific downstream tasks in the adaptation phase graph prompting is an effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while keeping pretrained gnn models frozen typically existing graph prompting studies mainly focus on featureoriented methods that apply graph prompts to node features or hidden representations however these studies often achieve suboptimal performance as they consistently overlook the potential of topologyoriented prompting which adapts pretrained gnns by modifying the graph topology in this study we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph prompting in terms of graph topology we propose the first graph topologyoriented prompting graphtop framework to effectively adapt pretrained gnn models for downstream tasks more specifically we reformulate topologyoriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within multihop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph sparsity extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pretraining strategies demonstrate that our proposed graphtop outshines six baselines on multiple node classification datasets our code is available at the choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks yet most architectures still rely on fixed uniform activation functions across all neurons we introduce smartmixed a twophase training strategy that allows networks to learn optimal perneuron activation functions while preserving computational efficiency at inference in the first phase neurons adaptively select from a pool of candidate activation functions relu sigmoid tanh leaky relu elu selu using a differentiable hardmixture mechanism in the second phase each neurons activation function is fixed according to the learned selection resulting in a computationally efficient network that supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations we evaluate smartmixed on the mnist dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying depths the analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct preferences for activation functions providing insights into the functional diversity within neural architectures room impulse response rir generation remains a critical challenge for creating immersive virtual acoustic environments current methods suffer from two fundamental limitations the scarcity of fullband rir datasets and the inability of existing models to generate acoustically accurate responses from diverse input modalities we present promptreverb a twostage generative framework that addresses these challenges our approach combines a variational autoencoder that upsamples bandlimited rirs to fullband quality khz and a conditional diffusion transformer model based on rectified flow matching that generates rirs from descriptions in natural language empirical evaluation demonstrates that promptreverb produces rirs with superior perceptual quality and acoustic accuracy compared to existing methods achieving mean rt error compared to for widely used baselines and yielding more realistic roomacoustic parameters our method enables practical applications in virtual reality architectural acoustics and audio production where flexible highquality rir synthesis is essential multiagent systems of large language models llms are rapidly expanding across domains introducing dynamics not captured by singleagent evaluations yet existing work has mostly contrasted the behavior of a single agent with that of a collective of fixed size leaving open a central question how does group size shape dynamics here we move beyond this dichotomy and systematically explore outcomes across the full range of group sizes we focus on multiagent misalignment building on recent evidence that interacting llms playing a ple coordination game can generate collective biases absent in individual models first we show that collective bias is a deeper phenomenon than previously assessed interaction can amplify individual biases introduce new ones or override modellevel preferences second we demonstrate that group size affects the dynamics in a nonlinear way revealing modeldependent dynamical regimes finally we develop a meanfield analytical approach and show that above a critical population size ulations converge to deterministic predictions that expose the basins of attraction of competing equilibria these findings establish group size as a key driver of multiagent dynamics and highlight the need to consider populationlevel effects when deploying llmbased systems at scale user behavior on online platforms is evolving reflecting realworld changes in how people post whether its helpful messages or hate speech models that learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over time due to data drift which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics systems however finetuning such a model over time with new data can be detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting replaybased approaches in continual learning offer a ple yet efficient method to update such models minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances from past learned tasks however the main limitation of this approach is the fixed size of the buffer external knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome this limitation through data augmentation we propose a novel augmentationbased approach to incorporate external knowledge in the replaybased continual learning framework we evaluate several strategies with three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replaybased approaches large visionlanguage models vlms face an inherent contradiction in image captioning their powerful singlestep generation capabilities often lead to a myopic decisionmaking process this makes it difficult to maintain global narrative coherence while capturing rich details a limitation that is particularly pronounced in tasks that require multistep and complex scene description to overcome this fundamental challenge we redefine image captioning as a goaloriented hierarchical refinement planning problem and further propose a novel framework named topdown semantic refinement tdsr which models the generation process as a markov decision process mdp however planning within the vast state space of a vlm presents a significant computational hurdle our core contribution therefore is the design of a highly efficient monte carlo tree search mcts algorithm tailored for vlms by incorporating a visualguided parallel expansion and a lightweight value network our tdsr reduces the call frequency to the expensive vlm by an order of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality furthermore an adaptive early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the images complexity extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including detailcaps compositioncap and pope demonstrate that our tdsr as a plugandplay module can significantly enhance the performance of existing vlms eg llava qwenvl by achieving stateoftheart or highly competitive results in finegrained description compositional generalization and hallucination suppression assessing published academic journal articles is a common task for evaluations of departments and individuals whilst it is sometimes supported by citation data large language models llms may give more useful indications of article quality evidence of this capability exists for two of the largest llm families chatgpt and gemini and the medium sized llm gemma but it is unclear whether smaller llms and reasoning models have ilar abilities this is important because larger models may be slow and impractical in some situations and reasoning models may perform differently four relevant questions are addressed with gemma variants llama scout qwen magistral small and deepseek on a dataset of medical health and life science papers in fields with two different gold standards one novel the results suggest that smaller open weights and reasoning llms have ilar performance to chatgpt omini and gemini flash but that parameters may often and sometimes be too few moreover averaging scores from multiple identical queries seems to be a universally successful strategy and fewshot prompts four examples tended to help but the evidence was equivocal reasoning models did not have a clear advantage overall the results show for the first time that smaller llms including reasoning models have a substantial capability to score journal articles for research quality especially if score averaging is used regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and improving the generalization performance of neural networks dropout a widely used regularization technique randomly deactivates units during training to introduce redundancy and prevent coadaptation among neurons despite its effectiveness dropout has limitations such as its static nature and lack of interpretability in this paper we propose a novel approach to regularization by substituting dropout with conways game of life gol a cellular automata with ple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells we introduce dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units as cells in a gol grid and applying the games rules to deactivate units this approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the training data potentially enhancing the networks ability to generalize we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the cifar dataset showing that dynamic unit deactivation using gol achieves comparable performance to traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the networks behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns furthermore our discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper architectures demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different dropout techniques deformable image registration estimates voxelwise correspondences between images through spatial transformations and plays a key role in medical imaging while deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of voxel correspondences promoting recent works to explore explicit feature matching among them voxeltoregion matching is more efficient for direct correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin neighbourhoods while regiontoregion matching incurs higher redundancy due to excessive correlation pairs across large regions however the inherent locality of voxeltoregion matching hinders the capture of longrange correspondences required for large deformations to address this we propose a recurrent correlationbased framework that dynamically relocates the matching region toward more promising positions at each step local matching is performed with low cost and the estimated offset guides the next search region supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations in addition we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity and decouples motionrelated and texture features to suppress semantic redundancy we conduct extensive experiments on brain mri and abdominal ct datasets under two settings with and without affine preregistration results show that our method exibits a strong accuracycomputation tradeoff surpassing or matching the stateoftheart performance for example it achieves comparable performance on the nonaffine oasis dataset while using only of the flops and running faster than rdp a representative highperforming method imagetoimage translation models have achieved notable success in converting images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such as predicting postoperative outcomes and modeling disease progression however most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images this limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions these challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy in this work we present tracetrans a novel deformable image translation model designed for postoperative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the preoperative input the framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image the predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output ensuring anatomical consistency with the source extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain mri datasets demonstrate that tracetrans delivers accurate and interpretable postoperative predictions highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment visualization a domainspecific yet widely used form of imagery is an effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights and its value depends on whether data are faithfully represented clearly communicated and aesthetically designed however evaluating visualization quality is challenging unlike natural images it requires ultaneous judgment across data encoding accuracy information expressiveness and visual aesthetics although multimodal large language models mllms have shown promising performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images no systematic benchmark exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations to address this we propose visjudgebench the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating mllms performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and quality it contains expertannotated samples from realworld scenarios covering single visualizations multiple visualizations and dashboards across chart types systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most advanced mllms such as gpt still exhibit significant gaps compared to human experts in judgment with a mean absolute error mae of and a correlation with human ratings of only to address this issue we propose visjudge a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and quality assessment experimental results demonstrate that visjudge significantly narrows the gap with human judgment reducing the mae to a reduction and increasing the consistency with human experts to a improvement compared to gpt the benchmark is available at in this paper we propose bootstrapped languageimage pretrainingdriven fused state representation in proximal policy optimization blipfuseppo a novel multimodal reinforcement learning rl framework for autonomous lanekeeping lk in which semantic embeddings generated by a visionlanguage model vlm are directly fused with geometric

controlaware representations to make policy learning more robust a hybrid reward function that includes semantic alignment lk accuracy obstacle avoidance and speed regulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable our method is different from the approaches that only use semantic models to shape rewards instead it directly embeds semantic features into the state representation this cuts down on expensive runtime inference and makes sure that semantic guidance is always available the ulation results show that the proposed model is better at lk stability and adaptability than the best visionbased and multimodal rl baselines in a wide range of difficult driving situations we make our code publicly available diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years producing highfidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property protection and the misuse of generative ai image watermarking for diffusion models particularly noiseaswatermark naw methods encode watermark as specific standard gaussian noise vector for image generation embedding the infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality for detection the generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing the watermark before extraction however existing naw methods struggle to balance watermark robustness with generation diversity some methods achieve strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling which degrades user experience while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile for realworld deployment to address this issue we propose tsmark a twostage watermarking scheme based on tailtruncated sampling tts unlike prior methods that ply map bits to positive or negative values tts enhances robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution our twostage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly generated session key into both encryption pipelines we evaluate tsmark on diffusion models with both unet and dit backbones extensive experiments show that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity our code is available at href while retrievalaugmented generation rag mitigates hallucination and knowledge staleness in large language models llms existing frameworks often falter on complex multihop queries that require synthesizing information from disparate sources current advanced rag methods employing iterative or adaptive strategies lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and fill evidence gaps often propagating noise or failing to gather a comprehensive context we introduce fairrag a novel agentic framework that transforms the standard rag pipeline into a dynamic evidencedriven reasoning process at its core is an iterative refinement cycle governed by a module we term structured evidence assessment sea the sea acts as an analytical gating mechanism it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and critically explicit informational gaps these gaps provide a precise signal to an adaptive query refinement agent which generates new targeted subqueries to retrieve missing information this cycle repeats until the evidence is verified as sufficient ensuring a comprehensive context for a final strictly faithful generation we conducted experiments on challenging multihop qa benchmarks including hotpotqa wikimultihopqa and musique in a unified experimental setup fairrag significantly outperforms strong baselines on hotpotqa it achieves an fscore of an absolute improvement of points over the strongest iterative baseline establishing a new stateoftheart

of humanoid codesign reconstructing visual stimuli from fmri signals is a central challenge bridging machine learning and neuroscience recent diffusionbased methods typically map fmri activity to a single highlevel embedding using it as fixed guidance throughout the entire generation process however this fixed guidance collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the stagedependent demands of image reconstruction in response we propose mindhier a coarsetofine fmritoimage reconstruction framework built on scalewise autoregressive modeling mindhier introduces three components a hierarchical fmri encoder to extract multilevel neural embeddings a hierarchytohierarchy alignment scheme to enforce layerwise correspondence with clip features and a scaleaware coarsetofine neural guidance strategy to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales these designs make mindhier an efficient and cognitivelyaligned alternative to diffusionbased methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that synthesizes global semantics before refining local details akin to human visual perception extensive experiments on the nsd dataset show that mindhier achieves superior semantic fidelity faster inference and more deterministic results than the diffusionbased baselines social media enables datadriven analysis of public opinion on

feasibility scope for realtime noninvasive estimation of laboratory values using risky text prompts such as pornography and violent prompts to test the safety of texttoimage ti models is a critical task however existing risky prompt datasets are limited in three key areas limited risky categories coarsegrained annotation and low effectiveness to address these limitations we introduce tiriskyprompt a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating safetyrelated tasks in ti models specifically we first develop a hierarchical risk taxonomy which consists of primary categories and finegrained subcategories building upon this taxonomy we construct a pipeline to collect and annotate risky prompts finally we obtain effective risky prompts where each prompt is annotated with both hierarchical category labels and detailed risk reasons moreover to facilitate the evaluation we propose a reasondriven risky image detection method that explicitly aligns the mllm with safety annotations based on tiriskyprompt we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight ti models nine defense methods five safety filters and five attack strategies offering nine key insights into the strengths and limitations of ti model safety finally we discuss potential applications of tiriskyprompt across various research fields the dataset and code are provided in homophily the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect is a fundamental property of realworld graphs underpinning structural and semantic patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks existing methods exploit homophily through designing homophilyaware gnn architectures or graph structure learning strategies yet they primarily focus on gnn learning with training graphs however in realworld scenarios test graphs often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts such as domain shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time periods these factors significantly compromise the pretrained models robustness resulting in degraded testtime performance with empirical observations and theoretical analysis we reveal that transforming the test graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance of pretrained gnns on node classifications without requiring model training or update motivated by these insights a novel testtime graph structural transformation method grounded in homophily named graphost is proposed specifically a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges facilitating adaptive testtime graph structural transformation by the confidence of predicted homophily scores extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets under a range of testtime data quality issues demonstrate that graphost consistently

paramount importance for achieving global sustainable development goals with the emergence of large visionlanguage models lvlms new opportunities have arisen to solve this task by treating it as a multimodal perception and understanding problem however recent studies reveal that lvlms still struggle with accurate and interpretable socioeconomic predictions from visual data to address these limitations and maximize the potential of lvlms we introduce cityrise a novel framework for reasontextbfing urban socioeconomic status in lvlms through pure reinforcement learning rl with carefully curated multimodal data and verifiable reward design our approach guides the lvlm to focus on semantically meaningful visual cues enabling structured and goaloriented reasoning for generalist socioeconomic status prediction experiments demonstrate that cityrise with emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines improving both prediction accuracy and generalization

benchmark evaluation contrastive learning machine learning has achieved remarkable successes yet its deployment in safetycritical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage uncertainty resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models encounter outofdistribution data adversarial perturbations or naturally fluctuating environments this thesis titled epistemic deep learning enabling machine learning models to know when they do not know addresses these critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of epistemic artificial intelligence which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty the uncertainty arising from limited biased or incomplete training data as opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty thereby empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high central to this work is the development of the randomset neural network rsnn a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief functions over sets of classes capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty through the width of associated credal sets applications of rsnn including its adaptation to large language models llms and its deployment in weather classification for autonomous racing in addition the thesis proposes a unified evaluation framework for uncertaintyaware classifiers extensive experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence where the ability to know when it does not know becomes a hallmark of robust and dependable systems the title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work asizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits of ones own knowledge electroencephalography eeg offers a noninvasive lens into human brain

standard cot but becomes detrimental on gpt vs for cot on full benchmark we trace this to a guardrailtohandcuff transition where constraints preventing commonsense errors in midtier models induce hyperliteralism in advanced models our detailed error analysis demonstrates that optimal prompting strategies must coevolve with model capabilities suggesting pler prompts for more capable models semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer vision gaining particular importance in realtime applications such as autonomous driving the main challenge is achieving high

modern layers and offchip memory utilization for skip connections provides a path for implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on fpga for realtime applications to outperform traditional gpu solutions in terms of power efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy the code for this project is publicly available at cgramlsemanticsegmentation large language models llms increasingly

opaque to the user through controlled experiments we find consistent reliability failures citation retrieval fails in of multireference queries sectionspecific content extraction fails in of cases and topical paper discovery yields scores below missing over of relevant literature further human analysis attributes these failures to the uncontrolled expansion of retrieved context and the tendency of llms to prioritize semantically relevant text over task instructions across basic tasks the llms display distinct failure behaviors chatgpt often withholds responses rather than risk errors whereas gemini produces fluent but fabricated answers to address these issues we develop lightweight reliability classifiers trained on paperask data to identify unreliable outputs paperask provides a

appendix further generalizes the utility to a referencedependent nonlinear form and proves its stability under reference shifts ensuring robustness of the framework applications to socialmedia algorithms and political trust illustrate how adversarial rationality can deliberately preserve fragility layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the efficiency of large language models llms although existing methods demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks their effect on longchain reasoning a more brittle yet crucial capability remains largely unexplored in this work we study the impact of layer pruning on longchain reasoning through the lens of testtime scaling a key mechanism in modern llms that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more computation at inference time with extensive experiments we demonstrate that pruning even one or two layers can severely impair testtime scaling with performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when performance on knowledgeintensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable furthermore we find that standard supervised finetuning remedies fail to recover testtime scaling once it has deteriorated through indepth analyses we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of testtime scaling and highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to reasoningintensive llms these findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the robustness of reasoning we

systems we measure llms output error at pairwise text comparison noting the probability of error in their preferences our method does not rely on the ground truth and supports two scenarios i uniform error rate regardless of the order of comparison estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with either text placed first ii binary positional bias assuming distinct error rates for the two orders of comparison estimated with repeated comparisons between the texts the copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared texts from pairwise preferences the ranking reveals the poor scalability of llmbased pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for llms error rates we apply the method to six llms chatgpt claude deepseek gemini grok qwen with five types of text input

of prompts claude obtained the most desirable performance in this experiment our model outperforms the biased bradleyterry model and the commutativity score in indicating llms error at this task domain adaptation da provides an effective way to tackle targetdomain tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains recent studies have extended this paradigm to multisource domain adaptation msda which exploits multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable information however a substantial performance gap still remains between adaptationbased methods and fully supervised learning in this paper we explore a more practical and challenging setting named multisource active domain adaptation msada to further enhance targetdomain performance by selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain the key difficulty of msada lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle interclass diversity and multisource domain variation to address these challenges we propose a ple yet effective gala strategy gala which combines a global kmeans clustering step for targetdomain samples with a clusterwise local selection criterion effectively tackling the above two issues in a complementary manner our proposed gala is plugandplay and can be seamlessly integrated into existing da frameworks without introducing any additional trainable parameters extensive experiments on three standard da benchmarks demonstrate that gala consistently outperforms prior active learning and active da methods achieving performance comparable to the fullysupervised upperbound while using only of the target annotations automated unit test generation is essential for robust software development yet existing approaches struggle to generalize across multiple programming languages and operate within realtime development while large language models llms offer a promising solution their ability to generate high coverage test code depends on

execution risk we assess the rl agents performance using the efficient frontier based on work by almgren and chriss measuring its ability to balance risk and cost results show that the rlderived strategies consistently outperform baselines and operate near the efficient frontier demonstrating a strong ability to optimise for risk and impact these findings highlight the potential of reinforcement learning as a powerful tool in the traders toolkit autonomous landing in unstructured cluttered uneven and mappoor environments is a core requirement for unmanned aerial vehicles uavs yet purely visionbased or deep learning models often falter under covariate shift and provide limited interpretability we propose neurosymland a neurosymbolic framework that tightly couples two

verifiable symbolic knowledge and ii an online pipeline where a compact foundationbased semantic segmentation model generates probabilistic scallop facts that are composed into semantic scene graphs for realtime deductive reasoning this design combines the perceptual strengths of lightweight foundation models with the interpretability and verifiability of symbolic reasoning node attributes eg flatness area and edge relations adjacency containment proximity are computed with geometric routines rather than learned avoiding the data dependence and latency of traintime graph builders the resulting scallop program encodes landing principles avoid water and obstacles prefer large flat accessible regions and yields calibrated safety scores with ranked regions of interest rois and humanreadable justifications extensive evaluations across datasets diverse ulation maps and real uav hardware show that neurosymland achieves higher accuracy stronger robustness to covariate shift and superior efficiency compared with stateoftheart baselines while advancing uav safety and reliability in emergency response surveillance and delivery missions taskspecific pretraining is essential when task representations diverge from generic pretraining features existing taskgeneral pretraining eeg models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches between taskspecific

across datasets enabling robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or persubject calibration to capture the longterm dependency and complex dynamics of eeg we propose a hybrid encoder combining a mambalike linear attention channel encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model our method outperforms stateoftheart largescale eeg models by an average of in auroc for fewshot emotion recognition and in accuracy for zeroshot generalization to a new dataset performance scales with the increase of datasets used in pretraining multidataset joint pretraining achieves a performance gain of over singledataset training this work provides a scalable framework for taskspecific pretraining and highlights its benefit in generalizable affective computing our code is available at scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic image generative models yet their mechanisms still remain opaque rather than advancing scaling our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and propose a ple nonparametric generative model our design is grounded in three principles of natural imagesi spatial nonstationarity ii lowlevel regularities and iii highlevel semanticsand defines each pixels distribution from its local context window despite its minimal architecture and no training the model produces highfidelity samples on mnist and visually compelling cifar images this combination of plicity and strong empirical performance points toward a minimal theory of naturalimage structure the models whitebox nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of how the model generalizes and generates diverse images we study it by tracing each generated pixel back to its source images these analyses reveal a ple compositional procedure for partwhole generalization suggesting a hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize mean field games mfgs have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling interactions in largescale multiagent systems despite recent advancements in reinforcement learning rl for mfgs existing methods are typically limited to finite spaces or stationary models hindering their applicability to realworld problems this paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning drl algorithm specifically designed for nonstationary continuous mfgs the proposed approach builds upon a fictitious play fp methodology leveraging drl for bestresponse computation and supervised learning for average policy representation furthermore it learns a representation of the timedependent population distribution using a conditional normalizing flow to validate the effectiveness of our method we evaluate it on three different examples of increasing complexity by addressing critical limitations in scalability and density imation this work represents a significant advancement in applying drl techniques to complex mfg problems bringing the field closer to realworld multiagent systems federated learning fl has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized model training enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model without exchanging their local data however the decentralized nature of fl also introduces vulnerabilities as malicious clients can compromise or manipulate the training process in this work we introduce dictator clients a novel welldefined and analytically tractable class of malicious participants capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the server model while preserving their own we propose concrete attack strategies that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the learning process furthermore we explore complex scenarios involving multiple dictator clients including cases where they collaborate act independently or form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another for each of these settings we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global models convergence our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks neural combinatorial optimization nco has achieved remarkable performance yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black box this impedes both academic research and practical deployment since researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into nco models in this paper we take the first critical step towards interpreting nco models by investigating their representations through various probing tasks moreover we introduce a novel probing tool named coefficient significance probing csprobing to enable deeper analysis of nco representations by examining the coefficients and statistical significance during probing extensive experiments and analysis reveal that nco models encode lowlevel information essential for solution construction while capturing highlevel knowledge to facilitate better decisions using csprobing we find that prevalent nco models impose varying inductive biases on their learned representations uncover direct evidence related to model generalization and identify key embedding dimensions associated with specific knowledge these insights can be potentially translated into practice for example with minor code modifications we improve the generalization of the analyzed model our work represents a first systematic attempt to interpret blackbox nco models showcasing probing as a promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights for the nco community the source code is publicly available machine unlearning mu aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful memory from a pretrained model the key challenge is to balance the potential tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation which involves forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the models original performance one potential way to tackle this problem is to use multiobjective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and utility preservation objectives however existing multiobjective methods only guarantee finding a paretooptimal solution without finegrained control which causes underoptimization of the unlearning objective to this end we first model mu as a constrained optimization problem that is optimizing the unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility loss we then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective to resolve the additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery we propose an implicit gradient surgery method which imates the solution to the aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation thereby achieving efficient utilitypreserving mu theoretically we provide a tight convergence analysis of the algorithm empirically our extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results than existing baselines codes are available at vision language models vlms achieve strong performance on many visionlanguage tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning a prerequisite for many applications empirically we find that a dataset produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a human validation rate these rates stem from current limitations singleimage reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer tolerances while captionbased methods require hyperdetailed annotations and suffer from generative hallucinations we present graid built on the key insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from geometric primitives alone by operating exclusively on bounding boxes from standard object detectors graid avoids both reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations resulting in datasets that are of higher quality than existing tools that produce ilar datasets as validated by human evaluations we apply our framework to the bddk nuimages and waymo datasets generating over million highquality vqa pairs creating questions spanning spatial relations counting ranking and size comparisons we evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves humanvalidated accuracy compared to on a dataset generated by recent work critically we demonstrate that when trained on graid data models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize models finetuned on question types improve on over heldout types with accuracy gains of on bdd and on nuimages for llama and when trained on all questions types achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as blink the graid framework datasets and additional information can be found this urlhere lowaltitude wireless networks lawns represent a promising architecture that integrates unmanned aerial vehicles uavs as aerial nodes to provide enhanced coverage reliability and throughput for diverse applications however these networks face significant security vulnerabilities from both known and potential unknown eavesdroppers which may threaten data confidentiality and system integrity to solve this critical issue we propose a novel secure communication framework for lawns where the selected uavs within a swarm function as a virtual antenna array vaa complemented by intelligent reflecting surface irs to create a robust defense against eavesdropping attacks specifically we formulate a multiobjective optimization problem that ultaneously maximizes the secrecy rate while minimizing the maximum sidelobe level and total energy consumption requiring joint optimization of uav excitation current weights flight trajectories and irs phase shifts this problem presents significant difficulties due to the dynamic nature of the system and heterogeneous components thus we first transform the problem into a heterogeneous markov decision process mdp then we propose a heterogeneous multiagent control approach hmca that integrates a dedicated irs control policy with a multiagent soft actorcritic framework for uav control which enables coordinated operation across heterogeneous network elements ulation results show that the proposed hmca achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches in terms of secrecy rate improvement sidelobe suppression and energy efficiency furthermore we find that the collaborative and passive beamforming synergy between vaa and irs creates robust security guarantees when the number of uavs increases we introduce ling a series reasoningoriented language foundation built upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability designed to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified mixtureofexperts moe paradigm ling asizes high sparsity crossscale consistency and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws the series includes three nonthinking instruct models lingmini lingflash and lingt ranging from to total parameters

heterogeneous pipelines at the trillion scale lingt establishes a new pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus computational efficiency demonstrating that sparse activation when properly aligned with reasoning objectives enables scalable and efficient intelligence collectively ling provides a coherent open and efficient foundation for advancing future reasoning and thinking models including the ring series built upon the same base most approaches to longcontext processing increase the complexity of the transformers internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as recurrence or auxiliary memory modules in this work we introduce an alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself rather than the transformer architecture inspired by cognitive models of human memory our method applies a scaleinvariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens the resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard unmodified transformer preserving architectural plicity we evaluate this approach on the wikitext and pg language modeling benchmarks showing a reduction in perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines moreover performance improves consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts showing that inputlevel logarithmic compression is a ple and effective way to extend a transformers longrange memory while lowaltitude wireless networks lawns based on uncrewed aerial vehicles uavs offer high mobility flexibility and coverage for urban communications they face severe signal attenuation in dense environments due to obstructions to address this critical issue we consider introducing collaborative beamforming cb of uavs and omnidirectional reconfigurable beamforming orb of ultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces starris to enhance the signal quality and directionality on this basis we formulate a joint rate and energy optimization problem jreop to maximize the transmission rate of the overall system while minimizing the energy consumption of the uav swarm due to the nonconvex and nphard nature of jreop we propose a heterogeneous multiagent collaborative dynamic hmcd optimization framework which has two core components the first component is a ulated annealing sabased starris control method which dynamically optimizes reflection and transmission coefficients to enhance signal propagation the second component is an improved multiagent deep reinforcement learning madrl control method which incorporates a selfattention evaluation mechanism to capture interactions between uavs and an adaptive velocity transition mechanism to enhance training stability ulation results demonstrate that hmcd outperforms various baselines in terms of convergence speed average transmission rate and energy consumption further analysis reveals that the average transmission rate of the overall system scales positively with both uav count and starris element numbers capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and promptbased image generation particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to multiple plausible outputs to generate diverse images reflecting this diversity traditional methods often modify random seeds making it difficult to discern meaningful differences between samples or diversify the input prompt which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity we propose rainbow a novel conditional image generation framework applicable to any pretrained conditional generative model that addresses inherent conditionprompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images rainbow is based on a ple yet effective idea decomposing the input condition into diverse latent representations each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and generating a distinct image first we integrate a latent graph parameterized by generative flow networks gflownets into the prompt representation computation second leveraging gflownets advanced graph sampling capabilities to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph we produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate rainbows improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis image generation and counterfactual generation tasks multimodal large language models mllms excel at visionlanguage tasks such as vqa and document understanding yet precise coordinate prediction remains challenging highresolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional biases in coordinate outputs we investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how mllms behave when visual positional encodings vpes are deliberately perturbed through shuffling our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce predictable nonrandom coordinate biases rather than random errors suggesting that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals are degraded crucially we observe ilar directional error patterns in natural highresolution datasets indicating that positional encoding failures are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale to address this issue we propose visionpe shuffle guidance vpsg a trainingfree testtime method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for correction vpsg runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled vpes to isolate positionunconditioned tendencies then uses this as negative evidence to guide digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight finitestate machine experiments on screenspotpro demonstrate reliable improvements highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor for spatial reasoning in mllms the field of computer architecture which bridges highlevel software abstractions and lowlevel hardware implementations remains absent from current large language model llm evaluations to this end we present quarch pronounced quark the first benchmark designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of llm knowledge and reasoning capabilities specifically in computer architecture quarch provides a comprehensive collection of expertvalidated questionanswer qa pairs covering various aspects of computer architecture including processor design memory systems and interconnection networks our evaluation reveals that while frontier models possess domainspecific knowledge they struggle with skills that require higherorder thinking in computer architecture frontier model accuracies vary widely from to on these advanced questions highlighting persistent gaps in architectural reasoning across analysis design and implementation qas by holistically assessing fundamental skills quarch provides a foundation for building and measuring llm capabilities that can accelerate innovation in computing systems with over contributors from institutions this benchmark represents a community effort to set the standard for architectural reasoning in llm evaluation large language models llms remain vulnerable to sophisticated prompt engineering attacks that exploit contextual framing to bypass safety mechanisms posing significant risks in cybersecurity applications we introduce jailbreak mimicry a systematic methodology for training compact attacker models to automatically generate narrativebased jailbreak prompts in a oneshot manner our approach transforms adversarial prompt discovery from manual craftsmanship into a reproducible scientific process enabling proactive vulnerability assessment in aidriven security systems developed for the openai gptossb redteaming challenge we use parameterefficient finetuning lora on mistralb with a curated dataset derived from advbench achieving an attack success rate asr against gptossb on a heldout test set of items crossmodel evaluation reveals significant variation in vulnerability patterns our attacks achieve asr against gpt on llama and against gemini flash demonstrating both broad applicability and modelspecific defensive strengths in cybersecurity contexts this represents a improvement over direct prompting asr and demonstrates systematic vulnerabilities in current safety alignment approaches our analysis reveals that technical domains cybersecurity asr and deceptionbased attacks fraud asr are particularly vulnerable highlighting threats to aiintegrated threat detection malware analysis and secure systems while physical harm categories show greater resistance asr we employ automated harmfulness evaluation using claude sonnet crossvalidated with human expert assessment ensuring reliable and scalable evaluation for cybersecurity redteaming finally we analyze failure mechanisms and discuss defensive strategies to mitigate these vulnerabilities in ai for cybersecurity we tackle the challenge of training reliable codefixing agents in real repositories where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation unstable we developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as postfix build validation and improved reproducibility across real issues by pinning dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades building on this we introduced a scalable plified pipeline for largescale reinforcement learning rl using this setup we supervised finetuned qwenb in the full pipeline and applied rl on top of the sft model in the plified environment the sft model distilled from gpt trajectories performs on par while being smaller and rl added absolute gains under matched traintest conditions thinking mode was on par or worse in our experiments both sft and rl models failed to generalize across environments highlighting the importance of matching traintest environments for building reliable realworld codefixing agents decomposing prediction uncertainty into its aleatoric irreducible and epistemic reducible components is critical for the development and deployment of machine learning systems a popular principled measure for epistemic uncertainty is the mutual information between the response variable and model parameters however evaluating this measure requires access to the posterior distribution of the model parameters which is challenging to compute in view of this we introduce a frequentist measure of epistemic uncertainty based on the bootstrap our main theoretical contribution is a novel asymptotic expansion that reveals that our proposed frequentist measure and the bayesian mutual information are asymptotically equivalent this provides frequentist interpretations to mutual information and new computational strategies for imating it moreover we link our proposed approach to the widelyused heuristic approach of deep ensembles giving added perspective on their practical success with the rise of online and virtual learning monitoring and enhancing student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education traditional methods of assessing a students involvement might not be applicable directly to virtual environments in this study we focused on this problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student engagement levels during online learning we proposed a novel training method which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for its predictions the proposed method offers benefits not only in the enforcement of ethical standards but also to enhance interpretability of the model predictions we applied an attributeorthogonal regularization technique to a splitmodel classifier which uses multiple transfer learning strategies to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of prediction for sensitivity groups from a pearson correlation coefficient of for the unmitigated model to for the mitigated model the source code for this project is available on anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to the diversity of abnormal events class imbalance and scenedependent visual clutter to address these issues we propose a robust deep learning framework that integrates humancentric preprocessing with spatiotemporal modeling for multiclass anomaly classification our pipeline begins by applying yoloworld an openvocabulary visionlanguage detector to identify human instances in raw video clips followed by bytetrack for consistent identityaware tracking background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via gaussian blurring effectively reducing scenespecific distractions and focusing the model on behaviorally relevant foreground content the refined frames are then processed by an imagenetpretrained inceptionv network for spatial feature extraction and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional lstm bilstm for sequencelevel classification evaluated on a fiveclass subset of the ucfcrime dataset normal burglary fighting arson explosion our method achieves a mean test accuracy of across three independent trials with perclass fscores consistently exceeding comprehensive evaluation metrics including confusion matrices roc curves and macroweighted averages demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance the results confirm that foregroundfocused preprocessing significantly enhances anomaly discrimination in realworld surveillance scenarios visionlanguage models vlms are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal content including presentation slides yet their slidespecific understanding remains underexplored despite their growing role as critics in agentic modelforward pipelines we introduce vlmslideeval an evaluation framework that probes vlms along three axes elementlevel extraction from slide images aligned to ground truth robustness to controlled perturbations in geometry style and text and higherlevel comprehension such as recovering a decks narrative order from shuffled slides using publicly available decks from zenodo we standardize groundtruth element metadata from powerpoint xml and live renderings into a unified verifiable schema empirically vlms underperform on pixelaccurate extraction and show nontrivial agreement fidelity and consistency under controlled perturbations while performing better on singleslide content understanding however they do not reliably capture narrative structure across slides these results highlight the limits of current vlms for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated criticintheloop evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines this work investigates how large language models llms internally represent emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hiddenstate space the paper identifies a lowdimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional representations are directionally encoded distributed across layers and aligned with interpretable dimensions these structures are stable across depth and generalize to eight realworld emotion datasets spanning five languages crossdomain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance indicating a universal emotional subspace within this space internal emotion perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned intervention module with especially strong control for basic emotions across languages these findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective geometry in llms and offer insight into how they internalize and process emotion causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial intelligence with farreaching implications for decisionmaking predictions and interventions despite significant advances existing methods can be broadly categorized as constraintbased or scorebased approaches constraintbased methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered by small sample sizes while scorebased methods provide flexible optimization but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing this work explores a third avenue developing differentiable dseparation scores obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic this enables the implementation of a new type of causal discovery method gradientbased optimization of conditional independence constraints empirical evaluations demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in lowsample regimes surpassing traditional constraintbased and scorebased baselines on a realworld dataset code and data of the proposed method are publicly available at we study the problem of offline safe reinforcement learning osrl where the goal is to learn a rewardmaximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative cost constraint we propose a novel osrl approach that frames the problem as a minimax objective and solves it by combining offline rl with online optimization algorithms we prove the imate optimality of this approach when integrated with an imate offline rl oracle and noregret online optimization we also present a practical imation that can be combined with any offline rl algorithm eliminating the need for offline policy evaluation empirical results on the dsrl benchmark demonstrate that our method reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets while achieving high rewards the code is available at we study the effect of normalization schemes on token representations in deep transformers modeling their evolution as interacting particles on the sphere we show that normalization acts as a form of speed regulation this perspective enables a unified analysis of several schemes including postln preln mixln periln ngpt and lnscaling revealing how they influence clustering dynamics and representation collapse our framework clarifies how different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a principled basis for comparing them identifying periln as a particularly effective choice discrete optimizationbased jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim to generate short nonsensical suffixes that when appended onto input prompts elicit disallowed content notably these suffixes are often transferable succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized and yet despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically wellestablished the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer occurs to fill this gap we identify three statistical properties that strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings how much a prompt without a suffix activates a models internal refusal direction how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction and how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal on the other hand we find that prompt semantic ilarity only weakly correlates with transfer success these findings lead to a more finegrained understanding of transferability which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack success sign languages play a crucial role in the communication of deaf communities but they are often marginalized limiting access to essential services such as healthcare and education this study proposes an automatic sign language recognition system based on a hybrid cnnlstm architecture using mediapipe for gesture keypoint extraction developed with python tensorflow and streamlit the system provides realtime gesture translation the results show an average accuracy of with very good performance for distinct gestures such as hello and thank you however some confusions remain for visually ilar gestures such as call and yes this work opens up interesting perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare education and public services generative ai genai is reshaping enterprise architecture work in agile software organizations yet evidence on its effects remains scattered we report a systematic literature review slr following established slr protocols of kitchenham and prisma of records yielding studies across enterprise solution domain business and it architect roles genai most consistently supports i design ideation and tradeoff exploration ii rapid creation and refinement of artifacts eg code models documentation and iii architectural decision support and knowledge retrieval reported risks include opacity and bias contextually incorrect outputs leading to rework privacy and compliance concerns and social loafing we also identify emerging skills and competencies including prompt engineering model evaluation and professional oversight and organizational enablers around readiness and adaptive governance the review contributes with a mapping of genai use cases and risks in agile architecting implications for capability building and governance and an initial research agenda on humanai collaboration in architecture overall the findings inform responsible adoption of genai that accelerates digital transformation while safeguarding architectural integrity understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central challenge especially in highstakes applications a promising approach is to equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions hypothetical what if scenarios that go beyond the observed data and provide insight into a model reasoning in this work we introduce the notion of causal interpretability which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data we analyze two common model classes blackbox and conceptbased predictors and show that neither is causally interpretable in general to address this gap we develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by design specifically we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query this leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive accuracy which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive expressiveness experiments corroborate the theoretical findings reinforcement learning rl promises to solve longhorizon tasks even when training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors this experience stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference td methods however outside of small tabular settings trajectories never intersect calling into question this conventional wisdom moreover the common belief is that monte carlo mc methods should not be able to recombine experience yet it remains unclear whether function imation could result in a form of implicit stitching the goal of this paper is to empirically study whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings where function imation is used we empirically demonstrate that monte carlo mc methods can also achieve experience stitching while td methods do achieve slightly stronger capabilities than mc methods in line with conventional wisdom that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between small and large neural networks even on quite ple tasks we find that increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both the mc and td methods these results suggest that the traditional td inductive bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for rl and in some cases may offer diminishing returns additionally our results suggest that stitching a form of generalization unique to the rl setting might be achieved not through specialized algorithms temporal difference learning but rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other machine learning settings via scale project website diffusion models such as diffusion policy have achieved stateoftheart results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations while diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation in this work we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied ai tasks particularly structured lowdimensional nature of action distributions diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as neural function evaluations nfe building on this insight we propose a populationbased sampling strategy genetic denoising which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low outofdistribution risk our method solves challenging tasks with only nfe while improving or matching performance we evaluate our approach across robotic manipulation tasks from drl and robomimic spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets in over million evaluations our method consistently outperforms standard diffusionbased policies achieving up to performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps despite recent advances large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs while prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human readability and transferability little attention has been paid to the linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a models susceptibility to such attacks in this paper we examine an interdisciplinary line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment constraints in llms drawing on wellestablished persuasive strategies we hypothesize that llms having been trained on largescale humangenerated text may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures furthermore we investigate whether llms themselves exhibit distinct persuasive fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses empirical evaluations across multiple aligned llms reveal that persuasionaware prompts significantly bypass safeguards demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors this work underscores the importance of crossdisciplinary insight in addressing the evolving challenges of llm safety the code and data are available reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards rlvr has delivered impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a standard posttraining paradigm for contemporary language and visionlanguage models however the rlvr recipe introduces a significant risk of capability regression where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training without employing regularization strategies we empirically confirm this concern observing that opensource reasoning models suffer performance degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness while imposing regularization terms like kl divergence can help prevent deviation from the base model these terms are calculated on the current task thus they do not guarantee broader knowledge meanwhile commonly used experience replay across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training focus each objective should receive to address this we propose recapa replay strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using shorthorizon signals of convergence and instability shifting the posttraining focus away from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones our method is endtoend and readily applicable to existing rlvr pipelines without training additional models or heavy tuning extensive experiments on benchmarks based on qwenvlb and qwenvlb demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves reasoning by enabling more flexible tradeoffs among intask rewards stack overflow so a leading online community forum is a rich source of software development knowledge however locating architectural knowledge such as architectural solutions remains challenging due to the overwhelming volume of unstructured content and fragmented discussions developers must manually sift through posts to find relevant architectural insights which is timeconsuming and errorprone this study introduces archisminer a framework for mining architectural knowledge from so the framework comprises two complementary components archpi and archispe archpi trains and evaluates multiple models including conventional mldl models pretrained language models plms and large language models llms and selects the bestperforming model to automatically identify architecturerelated posts arps among programmingrelated discussions archispe employs an indirect supervised approach that leverages diverse features

outperforms baselines in both se and nlp fields achieving fscores of for architectural issues and for solutions a user study further validated the quality eg relevance and usefulness of the identified arps and the extracted issuesolution pairs moreover we applied archisminer to three additional forums releasing a dataset of over architectural issuesolution pairs overall archisminer can help architects and developers identify arps and extract succinct relevant and useful architectural knowledge from developer communities more accurately and efficiently the replication package of this study has been provided at ransomware has become a critical threat to cybersecurity due to its rapid evolution the necessity for early detection and growing diversity posing significant challenges to traditional detection methods while aibased approaches had been proposed by prior works to assist ransomware detection existing methods suffer from three major limitations adhoc feature dependencies delayed response and limited adaptability to unseen variants in this paper we propose a framework that integrates selfsupervised contrastive learning with neural architecture search nas to address these challenges specifically this paper offers three important contributions we design a contrastive learning framework that incorporates hardware performance counters hpc to analyze the runtime behavior of target ransomware we introduce a customized loss function that encourages earlystage detection of malicious activity and significantly reduces the detection latency we deploy a neural architecture search nas framework to automatically construct adaptive model architectures allowing the detector to flexibly align with unseen ransomware variants experimental results show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in both detection accuracy up to and response time up to compared to existing approaches while maintaining robustness under evasive attacks novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges the noisy and highdimensional nature of experimental data and the necessity of making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers while there is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of scientific discovery in this work we directly address these challenges presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science we introduce autoscidact automated scientific discovery with anomalous contrastive testing a generalpurpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data autoscidact begins by creating expressive lowdimensional data representations using a contrastive pretraining leveraging the abundance of highquality ulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide principled data augmentation strategies these compact embeddings then enable an extremely sensitive machine learningbased twosample test using the new physics learning machine nplm framework which identifies and statistically quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution null hypothesis we perform experiments across a range of astronomical physical biological image and synthetic datasets demonstrating strong sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains the use of large language models llms to support tasks in software development has steadily increased over recent years from assisting developers in coding activities to providing conversational agents that answer newcomers questions in collaboration with the mozilla foundation this study evaluates the effectiveness of retrievalaugmented generation rag in assisting developers within the mozilla firefox project we conducted an empirical analysis comparing responses from human developers a standard gpt model and a gpt model enhanced with rag using real queries from mozillas developer chat rooms to ensure a rigorous evaluation mozilla experts assessed the responses based on helpfulness comprehensiveness and conciseness the results show that ragassisted responses were more comprehensive than human developers to and almost as helpful to suggesting rags potential to enhance developer assistance however the rag responses were not as concise and often verbose the results show the potential to apply ragbased tools to open source software oss to minimize the load to core maintainers without losing answer quality toning down retrieval mechanisms and making responses even shorter in the future would enhance developer assistance in massive projects like mozilla firefox large language models display incontext learning as an emergent effect of scale but they rely on static weights during inference in contrast biological systems continually adapt via synaptic plasticity we investigate whether explicit biologically inspired plasticity can endow transformers with faster insequence adaptation to this end we augment decoderonly transformers with fastweight modules updated either by i a neuromodulated hebbian rule or ii the gradientbased plasticity mechanism of duan et al across copying regression and fewshot classification tasks cifarfs omniglot hebbian plasticity consistently achieves lower loss and stronger fewshot generalization while gradientbased updates perform best on longhorizon credit assignment when associations are short and linearly separable static weights suffice defining a clear boundary condition for when plasticity helps analysis of learned modulatory signals reveals that gradientbased rules maintain large persistent updates whereas hebbian plasticity is sharply gated around salient events together these results show that explicit plasticity complements attention by enabling rapid taskspecific adaptation and clarify when different plasticity mechanisms are most effective evolutionary algorithms eas have proven effective in exploring the vast solution spaces typical of graphstructured combinatorial problems however traditional encoding schemes such as binary or numerical representations often fail to straightforwardly capture the intricate structural properties of networks through employing the imagebased encoding to preserve topological context this study utilizes multimodal large language models mllms as evolutionary operators to facilitate structureaware optimization over graph data to address the visual clutter inherent in largescale network visualizations we leverage graph sparsification techniques to plify structures while maintaining essential structural features to further improve robustness and mitigate bias from different sparsification views we propose a cooperative evolutionary optimization framework that facilitates crossdomain knowledge transfer and unifies multiple sparsified variants of diverse structures additionally recognizing the sensitivity of mllms to network layout we introduce an ensemble strategy that aggregates outputs from various layout configurations through consensus voting finally experiments on realworld networks through various tasks demonstrate that our approach improves both the quality and reliability of solutions in mllmdriven evolutionary optimization recent advances in coding agents have made them capable of planning editing running and testing complex code bases despite their growing ability in coding tasks these systems still struggle to infer and track user intent especially when instructions are underspecified or contextdependent to bridge this gap we introduce tomswe a dualagent architecture that pairs a primary softwareengineering swe agent with a lightweight theoryofmind tom partner agent dedicated to modeling the users mental state the tom agent infers user goals constraints and preferences from instructions and interaction history maintains a persistent memory of the user and provides userrelated suggestions to the swe agent in two software engineering benchmarks ambiguous swebench and stateful swebench tomswe improves task success rates and user satisfaction notably on the stateful swe benchmark a newly introduced evaluation that provides agents with a user ulator along with previous interaction histories tomswe achieves a substantially higher task success rate of compared to for openhands a stateoftheart swe agent furthermore in a threeweek study with professional developers using tomswe in their daily work participants found it useful of the time underscoring the value of stateful user modeling for practical coding agents software engineering agents sweagents have proven effective for traditional software engineering tasks with accessible codebases but their performance for embodied tasks requiring welldesigned information discovery remains unexplored we present the first extended evaluation of sweagents on controller generation for embodied tasks adapting minisweagent mswea to solve diverse embodied tasks from the minigrid environment our experiments compare agent performance across different information access conditions with and without environment source code access and with varying capabilities for interactive exploration we quantify how different information access levels affect sweagent performance for embodied tasks and analyze the relative importance of static code analysis versus dynamic exploration for task solving this work establishes controller generation for embodied tasks as a crucial evaluation domain for sweagents and provides baseline results for future research in efficient reasoning systems automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention yet most existing systems follow a oneshot paradigm where a large set of papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting this design often leads to noisy retrieval fragmented structures and context overload ultimately limiting survey quality inspired by the iterative reading process of human researchers we propose ours a framework based on recurrent outline generation in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves reads and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence to provide faithful paperlevel grounding we design paper cards that distill each paper into its contributions methods and findings and introduce a reviewandrefine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables experiments on both established and emerging topics show that ours substantially outperforms stateoftheart baselines in content coverage structural coherence and citation quality while producing more accessible and betterorganized surveys to provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements we further introduce surveyarena a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring and more clearly positions machinegenerated surveys relative to humanwritten ones the code is available at autosurveyv modern largescale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding network behaviors increasing the risk of misconfiguration prior work proposed to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations typically relying on domainspecific languages interfaced with formal models while effective they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility in contrast natural language nl offers a more accessible and interpretable interface motivating recent research on nlguided network behavior understanding recent advances in large language models llms further enhance this direction leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts and strong reasoning capabilities however three key challenges remain numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge llms longcontext understanding ability heterogeneity across devices and protocols impedes scalability and complex network topologies and protocols demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of llms to tackle the above challenges we propose netmind a novel framework for querying networks using nl our approach introduces a treebased configuration chunking strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning we then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to normalize vendorspecific configurations finally we design a hybrid imperativedeclarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on llms and enhance precision we contribute a benchmark consisting of nl questionanswer pairs paired with network configurations experiments demonstrate that netmind achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding outperforming existing baselines to deploy large language models llms in highstakes application domains that require substantively accurate responses to openended prompts we need reliable computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness of longform responses generated by llms however existing approaches often rely on claimbyclaim factchecking which is computationally expensive and brittle in longform responses to openended prompts in this work we introduce semantic isotropy the degree of uniformity across normalized text embeddings on the unit sphere and use it to assess the trustworthiness of longform responses generated by llms to do so we generate several longform responses embed them and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere we find that higher semantic isotropy that is greater embedding dispersion reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples our approach requires no labeled data no finetuning and no hyperparameter selection and can be used with open or closedweight embedding models across multiple domains our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting nonfactuality in longform responses using only a handful of samples offering a practical lowcost approach for integrating trust assessment into realworld llm workflows this monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development of diffusion models tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations arise from shared mathematical ideas diffusion modeling starts by defining a forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise linking the data distribution to a ple prior through a continuum of intermediate distributions the goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise back into data while recovering the same intermediates we describe three complementary views the variational view inspired by variational autoencoders sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step the scorebased view rooted in energybased modeling learns the gradient of the evolving data distribution indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely regions the flowbased view related to normalizing flows treats generation as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a learned velocity field these perspectives share a common backbone a timedependent velocity field whose flow transports a ple prior to the data sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise into data along a continuous trajectory on this foundation the monograph discusses guidance for controllable generation efficient numerical solvers and diffusionmotivated flowmap models that learn direct mappings between arbitrary times it provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deeplearning knowledge in recent years deep learning based generative models particularly generative adversarial networks gans variational autoencoders vaes and diffusion models dms have been instrumental in in generating diverse highquality content across various domains such as image and video synthesis this capability has led to widespread adoption of these models and has captured strong public interest as they continue to advance at a rapid pace the growing volume of research expanding application areas and unresolved technical challenges make it increasingly difficult to stay current to address this need this survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the literature and provides a cohesive framework for understanding the development of gans vaes and dms including their many variants and combined approaches we highlight key innovations that have improved the quality diversity and controllability of generated outputs reflecting the expanding potential of generative artificial intelligence in addition to summarizing technical progress we examine rising ethical concerns including the risks of misuse and the broader societal impact of synthetic media finally we outline persistent challenges and propose future research directions offering a structured and forward looking perspective for researchers in this fast evolving field large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when finetuned on benign data a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting prior work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect but it remains unclear which examples are most effective we propose a behavioraware sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary factors instructionresponse behavior eg refusal versus compliance and semantic diversity across harm categories systematic evaluation shows that this approach substantially

completeness in neural language models conventional research on large language models llms has primarily focused on refining output distributions while paying less attention to the decoding process that transforms these distributions into final responses recent advances such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models have underscored the importance of decoding but these methods often suffer from high computational costs and limited applicability in this paper we revisit llm generation through the lens of recommender systems conceptualizing the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation pipelines from this perspective we observe that both traditional decoding methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy

an ubiquitous and intuitive guitarspecific symbolic format the tablature format easily represents guitarspecific playing techniques eg bends muted strings and legatos which are more difficult to represent in other common music notation formats such as midi our model relies on an intermediary step of first rendering the tablature to audio using a ple samplebased virtual instrument then performing style transfer using flow matching in order to transform the virtual instrument audio into more realistic sounding examples this results in a model that is quick to train and to perform

exhibits emerging potential for medical image interpretation its diagnostic reliability remains limited continued advances in visual reasoning and domainspecific adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical practice manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a slow process for retailers although generative ai provides an automation solution in form of vision to language models vlm the current vlms are prone to factual hallucinations siloed single task models are not only inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between features to address these challenges we propose an end to end multi task system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image the contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture first application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute prediction such as color hemline and neck style and price regression second introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the models own predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed

high dynamic range hdr imaging aims to reproduce the wide range of brightness levels present in natural scenes which the human visual system can perceive but conventional digital cameras often fail to capture due to their limited dynamic range to address this limitation we propose a deep learningbased multiexposure fusion approach for hdr image generation the method takes a set of differently exposed low dynamic range ldr images typically an underexposed and an overexposed image and learns to fuse their complementary information using a convolutional neural network cnn the underexposed image preserves details in bright regions while the overexposed image retains information in dark regions the network effectively combines these to reconstruct a highquality hdr output the model is trained in an unsupervised manner without relying on groundtruth hdr images making it practical for realworld applications where such data is unavailable we evaluate our results using the

benchmarks significantly outperforming existing approaches recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models particularly via training on tasks with verifiable rewards yet a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real world multimodal scenarios most notably vision language tasks due to a heavy focus on single modal language settings while efforts to transplant reinforcement learning techniques from nlp to vlms have emerged these approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images to textual summaries failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense knowledge ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities across diverse multimodal environments to address this limitation we introduce a novel fine tuning task masked prediction via context and commonsense which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded images thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning to systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning we developed a specialized evaluation benchmark mpcc eval and employed various fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning among these we introduced an innovative training method reinforcement fine tuning with prior sampling which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized reasoning capabilities in ood and cross task scenarios with the rapid growth of video data textvideo retrieval technology has become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as recommendation and search early textvideo retrieval methods suffer from two critical drawbacks first they heavily rely on

committee of experts to generate the most accurate response our results introduce new methodologies and noregret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the performance of the an aggregate model overall script event induction which aims to predict the subsequent event based on the context is a challenging task in nlp achieving remarkable success in practical applications however human events are mostly recorded and presented in the form of videos rather than scripts yet there is a lack of related research in the realm of vision to address this problem we introduce avep actioncentric video event prediction a task that distinguishes itself from existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic and richer semantic information we present a large structured dataset which consists of about annotated videos and more than video clips of event built upon existing video event datasets to support this task the dataset offers more finegrained annotations where the atomic unit is represented as a multimodal event argument node providing better structured representations of video events due to the complexity of event structures traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not wellsuited for avep we propose eventformer a nodegraph hierarchical attention based video event prediction model which can capture both the relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial relationships between arguments we conducted experiments using several sota video prediction models as well as lvlms on avep demonstrating both the complexity of the task and the value of the dataset our approach outperforms all these video prediction models we will release the dataset and code for replicating the experiments and annotations diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating highquality images a typical example is texttoimage generator like stable diffusion however their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks a key concern is membership inference attacks which attempt to determine whether a particular data sample was used in the model training process we propose an efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models this method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the aggregation degree of the noise distribution the intuition is that the noise prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and nontraining set samples exhibit distinguishable we suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around a certain time step of the diffusion process in contrast the predicted noises of nonmember images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain time step compared with other existing methods our proposed method requires fewer visits to the target diffusion model we inject slight noise into the image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model empirical findings indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple datasets at the same time our method can also show better attack effects in asr and auc when facing largescale texttoimage diffusion models proving the scalability of our method realtime video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge devices to reduce latency however the distribution of data features may change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather conditions leading to decreased model accuracy recent frameworks try to address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud despite these advancements existing methods face two key challenges first the retraining process is computeintensive causing significant delays in model updates second the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of the current video stream to address these challenges we introduce edgesync an efficient edgemodel updating approach that enhances sample filtering by incorporating timeliness and inference results thus ensuring training samples are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays additionally edgesync features a dynamic training management module that optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their timeliness evaluations on diverse and complex realworld datasets demonstrate that edgesync improves accuracy by imately compared to existing methods and by about compared to traditional approaches in this study we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from digitized fine needle aspirate fna images of breast masses our deep neural network using relu activations the adam optimizer and a binary crossentropy loss delivers stateoftheart classification performance achieving an accuracy of precision of recall of and an score of these results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the literature we evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of wellestablished algorithms logistic regression decision trees random forests stochastic gradient descent knearest neighbors and xgboost and found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics recognizing that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due to the blackbox nature of deep learning models we incorporated modelagnostic explainable ai techniques such as shap and lime to produce featurelevel attributions and humanreadable visualizations these explanations quantify the contribution of each feature to individual predictions support error analysis and increase clinician trust thus bridging the gap between performance and interpretability for realworld clinical use the concave points feature of the cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting the classification task this insight can be very helpful in improving the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key characteristics of breast tumor background aspiration the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality this study develops a machine learning ml model to predict postoperative aspiration enabling timely preventative interventions methods from the mimiciv database of over hospital admissions we identified surgical patients mean age male who experienced aspiration within seven days postsurgery along with a matched nonaspiration cohort three ml models xgboost multilayer perceptron and random forest were trained using presurgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative aspiration to investigate causation we estimated average treatment effects ate using augmented inverse probability weighting results our ml model achieved an auroc of and sensitivity on a heldout test set maximum daily opioid dose length of stay and patient age emerged as the most important predictors ate analysis identified significant causative factors opioids and operative site neck head despite equal surgery rates across genders men were times more likely to aspirate and received higher maximum daily opioid dosages compared to women conclusion ml models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk enabling targeted preventative measures maximum daily opioid dosage and operative site significantly influence aspiration risk the gender disparity in both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation these findings have important implications for improving postoperative care protocols and aspiration prevention strategies in facial image generation current texttoimage models often suffer from facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding to local semantic instructions in this study we propose facemakeupv a facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face id and physical characteristics with the reference image first we constructed a largescale dataset facecaptionmaskm comprising imately one million imagetextmasks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local semantic instructions second we employed a general texttoimage pretrained model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information injection channels a facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel third we formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our model semantic alignment in the models embedding space to mitigate the attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve id consistency extensive experiments demonstrated that our facemakeupv achieves best overall performance in terms of preserving face id and maintaining physical consistency of the reference images these results highlight the practical potential of facemakeupv for reliable and controllable facial editing in diverse applications we present ocrquality a comprehensive humanannotated dataset designed for evaluating and developing ocr quality assessment methods the dataset consists of pdf pages converted to png images at dpi sampled from diverse realworld scenarios including academic papers textbooks ebooks and multilingual documents each document has been processed using stateoftheart visionlanguage models vlms and manually annotated with quality scores using a level scoring system excellent good fair poor the dataset includes detailed source information annotation guidelines and representative cases across various difficulty levels ocrquality addresses the critical need for reliable ocr quality assessment in realworld applications and provides a valuable benchmark for training and evaluating ocr verification systems the dataset is publicly available at while modern texttoimage diffusion models generate highfidelity images they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the output to address this we introduce and evaluate two controlnets specialized for artistic control a proportion controlnet that uses bounding boxes to dictate the position and scale of objects and a perspective controlnet that employs vanishing lines to control the geometry of the scene we support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage visionlanguage models for annotation and specialized algorithms for conditioning image synthesis our experiments demonstrate that both modules provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints both models are released on huggingface we introduce jora a novel multimodal dataset that bridges the gap in robot perception by providing detailed object attribute annotations within japanese humanrobot dialogue scenarios jora is designed to support three critical perception tasks object identification reference resolution and nextaction prediction by leveraging a comprehensive template of attributes eg category color shape size material and spatial relations extensive evaluations with both proprietary and opensource vision language models vlms reveal that incorporating detailed object attributes substantially improves multimodal perception performance compared to without object attributes despite the improvement we find that there still exists a gap between proprietary and opensource vlms in addition our analysis of object affordances demonstrates varying abilities in understanding object functionality and contextual relationships across different vlms these findings underscore the importance of rich contextsensitive attribute annotations in advancing robot perception in dynamic environments see project page at data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news stories current visionlanguage models vlms still struggle on basic data visualization understanding tasks but the causes of failure remain unclear are vlm failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the data visualization is encoded how information is transferred between the vision and language modules or how information is processed within the language module we developed fugu a suite of data visualization understanding tasks to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty eg extracting the position of data points distances between them and other summary statistics we used fugu to investigate three widely used vlms to diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models we used activation patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a variety of prompting strategies we found that some models fail to generate the coordinates of individual data points correctly and these initial errors often lead to erroneous final responses when these models are provided with the correct coordinates performance improves substantially moreover even when the model generates an incorrect response the correct coordinates can be successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the visionlanguage handoff we further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks involving one or a small number of data points it generally worsens performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across many data points finetuning models on fugu also fails to yield ceiling performance these findings point to architectural constraints in current vlms that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization understanding with the rapid advancement of large language models llms their capabilities in various automation domains particularly unmanned aerial vehicle uav operations have garnered increasing attention current research remains predominantly constrained to smallscale uav applications with most studies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones while lacking comprehensive investigation of medium and longrange uav systems in realworld operational contexts larger uav platforms introduce distinct challenges including stringent requirements for airportbased takeoff and landing procedures adherence to complex regulatory frameworks and specialized operational capabilities with elevated mission expectations this position paper presents the nextgeneration llm for uav nelv system a comprehensive demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating llms into multiscale uav operations the nelv system processes natural language instructions to orchestrate short medium and longrange uav missions through five key technical components i llmasparser for instruction interpretation ii route planner for points of interest poi determination iii path planner for waypoint generation iv control platform for executable trajectory implementation and uav monitoring we demonstrate the systems feasibility through three representative use cases spanning different operational scales multiuav patrol multipoi delivery and multihop relocation beyond the current implementation we establish a fivelevel automation taxonomy that charts the evolution from current llmasparser capabilities level to fully autonomous llmasautopilot systems level identifying technical prerequisites and research challenges at each stage this study introduces a novel control framework for adaptive cruise control acc in automated driving leveraging long shortterm memory lstm networks and physicsinformed constraints as automated vehicles avs adopt advanced features like acc transportation systems are becoming increasingly intelligent and efficient however existing av control strategies primarily focus on optimizing the performance of individual vehicles or platoons often neglecting their interactions with humandriven vehicles hvs and the broader impact on traffic flow this oversight can exacerbate congestion and reduce overall system efficiency to address this critical research gap we propose a neural networkbased socially compliant av control framework that incorporates social value orientation svo this framework enables avs to account for their influence on hvs and traffic dynamics by leveraging avs as mobile traffic regulators the proposed approach promotes adaptive driving behaviors that reduce congestion improve traffic efficiency and lower energy consumption within this framework we define utility functions for both avs and hvs which are optimized based on the svo of each av to balance its own control objectives with broader traffic flow considerations numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting to varying traffic conditions thereby enhancing systemwide efficiency specifically when the avs control mode shifts from prioritizing energy consumption to optimizing traffic flow efficiency vehicles in the following platoon experience at least a increase in individual energy consumption alongside at least a improvement in individual average speed indicating significant enhancements in traffic dynamics internal combustion engine ice vehicles and electric vehicles evs exhibit distinct vehicle dynamics evs provide rapid acceleration with electric motors producing peak power across a wider speed range and achieve swift deceleration through regenerative braking while existing microscopic models effectively capture the driving behavior of ice vehicles a modeling framework that accurately describes the unique carfollowing dynamics of evs is lacking developing such a model is essential given the increasing presence of evs in traffic yet creating an easytouse and accurate analytical model remains challenging to address these gaps this study develops and validates a phaseaware ai paai carfollowing model specifically for evs the proposed model enhances traditional physicsbased frameworks with an ai component that recognizes and adapts to different driving phases such as rapid acceleration and regenerative braking using realworld trajectory data from vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control acc we conduct comprehensive ulations to validate the models performance the numerical results demonstrate that the paai model significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional carfollowing models providing an effective tool for accurately representing ev behavior in traffic ulations dense embedding models have become critical for modern information retrieval particularly in rag pipelines but their performance often degrades when applied to specialized corpora outside their pretraining distribution to address thi we introduce customir a framework for unsupervised adaptation of pretrained language embedding models to domainspecific corpora using synthetically generated querydocument pairs customir leverages large language models llms to create diverse queries grounded in a known target corpus paired with llmverified hard negatives eliminating the need for costly human annotation experiments on enterprise email and messaging datasets show that customir consistently improves retrieval effectiveness with small models gaining up to points in recall this performance increase allows these small models to rival the performance of much larger alternatives allowing for cheaper rag deployments these results highlight that targeted synthetic finetuning offers a scalable and costefficient strategy for increasing domainspecific performance bias in recommender systems not only distorts user experience but also perpetuates and amplifies existing societal stereotypes particularly in sectors like fashion ecommerce this study employs a dynamic modeling approach to scrutinize the mechanisms of bias activation and reinforcement within fashion recommender systems frs by leveraging system dynamics modeling and experimental ulations we dissect the temporal evolution of bias and its multifaceted impacts on system performance our analysis reveals that inductive biases exert a more substantial influence on system outcomes than user biases suggesting critical areas for intervention we demonstrate that while current debiasing strategies including data rebalancing and algorithmic regularization are effective to an extent they require further enhancement to comprehensively mitigate biases this research underscores the necessity for advancing these strategies and extending system boundaries to incorporate broader contextual factors such as user demographics and item diversity aiming to foster inclusivity and fairness in frs the findings advocate for a proactive approach in recommender system design to counteract bias propagation and ensure equitable user experiences dense retrievers enhance retrieval by encoding queries and documents into continuous vectors but they often struggle with reasoningintensive queries although large language models llms can reformulate queries to capture complex reasoning applying them universally incurs significant computational cost in this work we propose adaptive query reasoning adaqr a hybrid query rewriting framework within this framework a reasoner router dynamically directs each query to either fast dense reasoning or deep llm reasoning the dense reasoning is achieved by the dense reasoner which performs llmstyle reasoning directly in the embedding space enabling a controllable tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy experiments on largescale retrieval benchmarks bright show that adaqr reduces reasoning cost by while preservingor even improvingretrieval performance by underwater activities like scuba diving enable millions annually to explore marine environments for recreation and scientific research maintaining situational awareness and effective communication are essential for diver safety traditional underwater communication systems are often bulky and expensive limiting their accessibility to divers of all levels while recent systems leverage lightweight smartphones and support text messaging the messages are predefined and thus restrict contextspecific communication in this paper we present aquavlm a tapandsend underwater communication system that automatically generates contextaware messages and transmits them using ubiquitous smartphones our system features a mobile visionlanguage model vlm finetuned on an autogenerated underwater conversation dataset and employs a hierarchical message generation pipeline we codesign the vlm and transmission incorporating errorresilient finetuning to improve the systems robustness to transmission errors we develop a vr ulator to enable users to experience aquavlm in a realistic underwater environment and create a fully functional prototype on the ios platform for realworld experiments both subjective and objective evaluations validate the effectiveness of aquavlm and highlight its potential for personal underwater communication as well as broader mobile vlm applications as generative ai increasingly outperforms students in producing academic writing a critical

arxiv version thus provides both a descriptive report of design and usage and a forwardlooking provocation for future empirical studies this project explores the development of an aienhanced operator assistant for unicos cerns unified industrial control system while powerful unicos presents a number of challenges including the cognitive burden of decoding widgets manual effort required for root cause analysis and difficulties maintainers face in tracing datapoint elements dpes across a complex codebase in situations where timely responses are critical these challenges can increase cognitive load and slow down diagnostics to address these issues a multiagent system was designed and implemented the solution is supported by a modular architecture comprising a unicosside extension written in ctrl code a pythonbased multiagent system deployed on a virtual machine and a vector database storing both operator documentation and widget animation code preliminary evaluations suggest that the system is capable of decoding widgets performing root cause analysis by leveraging live device data and documentation and tracing dpes across a complex codebase together these capabilities reduce the manual workload of operators and maintainers enhance situational awareness in operations and accelerate responses to alarms and anomalies beyond these immediate gains this work highlights the potential of introducing multimodal reasoning and retrieval augmented generation rag into the domain of industrial control ultimately this work represents more than a proof of concept it provides a basis for advancing intelligent operator interfaces at cern by combining modular design extensibility and practical ai integration this project not only alleviates current operator pain points but also points toward broader opportunities for assistive ai in accelerator operations widespread frustration with rigid touchtone interactive voice response ivr systems for customer service underscores the need for more direct and intuitive language interaction while speech technologies are necessary the key challenge lies in routing intents from user phrasings to ivr menu paths a task where large language models llms show strong potential progress however is limited by data scarcity as real ivr structures and interactions are often proprietary we present a novel llmbased methodology to address this gap using three distinct models we synthesized a realistic node ivr structure generated user intents base and augmented and performed the routing task we evaluate two prompt designs descriptive hierarchical menus and flattened path representations across both base and augmented datasets results show that flattened paths consistently yield higher accuracy reaching on the base dataset compared to with the descriptive format while augmentation introduces linguistic noise that slightly reduces performance confusion matrix analysis further suggests that lowperforming routes may reflect not only model limitations but also redundancies in menu design overall our findings demonstrate proofofconcept that llms can enable ivr routing through a smoother more seamless user experience moving customer service one step ahead of touchtone menus retrievalaugmented generation rag systems have emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing large language models llms through the dynamic integration of external knowledge to further improve rags flexibility agentic rag introduces autonomous agents into the workflow however agentic rag faces several challenges the success of each step depends on both highquality planning and accurate search the lack of supervision for intermediate reasoning steps and the exponentially large candidate space for planning and searching to address these challenges we propose decouplesearch a novel framework that decouples planning and search processes using dual value models enabling independent optimization of plan reasoning and search grounding our approach constructs a reasoning tree where each node represents planning and search steps we leverage monte carlo tree search to assess the quality of each step during inference hierarchical beam search iteratively refines planning and search candidates with dual value models extensive experiments across policy models of varying parameter sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements processing millions of transactions daily with zerodowntime expectations traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical infrastructure metrics and business process visibility we introduce a novel feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between consecutive iso message exchanges creating a compact representation of system state by applying anomaly detection to these features we enable early failure detection and localization allowing incident classification experimental evaluation on the target instant payment settlement tips system using both realworld incidents and controlled ulations demonstrates the approachs effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the business impact by mapping features to distinct processing phases the resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system issues significantly reduces investigation time and bridges observability gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across multiple entities high quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model based software engineering swe agents we introduce a novel method for synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs our method instructs swe agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may unintentionally break tests resulting in bugs prior approaches often induce an outofdistribution effect by generating bugs intentionally eg by introducing local perturbation to existing code which does not reflect realistic development processes we perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found in humanauthored edits through extensive experiments we demonstrate that our bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised finetuning outperforming other bug datasets by with half the training data vs bugs we train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug datasets to get frogboss a stateoftheart parameter model on swebench verified with a pass of and frogmini a stateoftheart model on swebench verified with a pass of on swebench verified averaged over three seeds given a graph its independence sequence is the integral sequence aaan where ai is the number of independent sets of vertices of size i in the late alavi erdos malde schwenk showed that this sequence need not be unimodal for general graphs but conjectured that it is always unimodal whenever is a tree this conjecture was then naturally generalized to claim that the independence sequence of trees should be log concave in the sense that ai is always above aiai this conjecture stood for many years until in kadrawi levit yosef and mizrachi proved that there were exactly two trees on vertices whose independence sequence was not log concave in this paper we use the ai architecture patternboost developed by charton ellenberg wagner and williamson to train a machine to find counterexamples to the logconcavity conjecture we will discuss the successes of this approach finding tens of thousands of new counterexamples to logconcavity with vertex set sizes varying from to and some of its fascinating failures with the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data visualizing it and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes heart disease and depression however this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of humanmachine interaction this paper proposes remoni an autonomous remote health monitoring system that integrates multimodal large language models mllms the internet of things iot and wearable devices the system automatically and continuously collects vital signs accelerometer data from a special wearable such as a smartwatch and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras this data is processed by an anomaly detection module which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patients emergency conditions a distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component developed with mllms capable of detecting and recognizing a patients activity and emotion while responding to healthcare

potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs a fullfledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities context and motivation large language models llms show notable results in natural language processing nlp tasks for requirements engineering re however their use is compromised by high computational cost data sharing risks and dependence on external services in contrast small language models slms offer a lightweight locally deployable alternative questionproblem it remains unclear how well slms perform compared to llms in re tasks in terms of accuracy results our preliminary study compares eight models including three llms and five slms on requirements classification tasks using the promise promise reclass and secreq datasets our results show that although llms achieve an average score of higher than slms this difference is not statistically significant slms almost reach llms performance across all datasets and even outperform them in recall on the promise reclass dataset despite being up to times smaller we also found that dataset characteristics play a more significant role in performance than model size contribution our study contributes with evidence that slms are a valid alternative to llms for requirements classification offering advantages in privacy cost and local deployability as generative ai continues to evolve vision language models vlms have emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications one area that remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition har for remote health monitoring vlms offer notable strengths including greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of traditional deep learning models however a key challenge in applying vlms to har lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often nondeterministic outputs to address this gap we introduce a descriptive caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate vlms in har through comparative experiments with stateoftheart deep learning models our findings demonstrate that vlms achieve comparable performance and in some cases even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy this work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the integration of vlms into intelligent healthcare systems we introduce dreamervxp an extension of dreamerv that improves exploration and learning efficiency this includes i a prioritized replay buffer scoring trajectories by return reconstruction loss and value error and ii an intrinsic reward based on disagreement over predicted environment rewards from an ensemble of world models dreamervxp is evaluated on a subset of atarik and deepmind control visual benchmark tasks confirming the original dreamerv results and showing that our extensions lead to faster learning and lower dynamics model loss particularly in sparsereward settings associative learningforming links between cooccurring itemsis fundamental to human cognition reshaping internal representations in complex ways testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological systems is challenging but large language models llms offer a scalable alternative building on llms incontext learning we adapt a cognitive neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations evolve across six models our initial findings reveal a nonmonotonic pattern consistent with the nonmonotonic plasticity hypothesis with moderately ilar items differentiating after learning leveraging the controllability of llms we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of associated items with the broader vocabularya factor we term vocabulary interference capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge we find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation suggesting that representational change is influenced by both item ilarity and global competition our findings position llms not only as powerful tools for studying representational dynamics in humanlike learning systems but also as accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain large language models llms are used for registertransfer level rtl code generation but they face two main challenges functional correctness and power performance and area ppa optimization iterative feedbackbased methods partially address these but they are limited to local search hindering the discovery of a global optimum this paper introduces revolution a framework that combines evolutionary computation ec with llms for automatic rtl generation and optimization revolution evolves a population of candidates in parallel each defined by a

respectively an adaptive mechanism further improves search efficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt strategy according to its success rate experiments on the verilogeval and rtllm benchmarks show that revolution increased the initial pass rate of various llms by up to percentage points the deepseekv model achieved a final pass rate of comparable to stateoftheart results without the need for separate training or domainspecific tools additionally the generated rtl designs showed significant ppa improvements over reference designs this work introduces a new rtl design approach by combining llms generative capabilities with ecs broad search power overcoming the localsearch limitations of previous methods artificial intelligence ai systems

variability notably transparent ai assistance applied as a targeted qc step yields median eventlevel performance improvements of imately over blackbox assistance and qc timing further enhances countbased outcomes while wb and qc approaches increase the time required for scoring starttime assistance is faster and preferred by most participants participants overwhelmingly favor transparency with seven out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no modifications in summary strategically timed transparent ai assistance effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency providing a promising pathway toward trustworthy ai integration and user acceptance in clinical workflows conventional convolutional neural networks cnns in the real domain have been widely used for audio classification however their convolution operations process multichannel inputs independently limiting the ability to capture correlations among channels this can lead to suboptimal feature learning particularly for complex audio patterns such as multichannel spectrogram representations quaternion convolutional neural networks qcnns address this limitation by employing quaternion algebra to jointly capture interchannel dependencies enabling more compact models with fewer learnable parameters while better exploiting the multidimensional nature of audio signals however qcnns exhibit higher computational complexity due to the overhead of quaternion operations resulting in increased inference latency and reduced efficiency compared to conventional cnns posing challenges for deployment on resourceconstrained platforms to address this challenge this study explores knowledge distillation kd and pruning to reduce the computational complexity of qcnns while maintaining performance our experiments on audio classification reveal that pruning qcnns achieves ilar or superior performance compared to kd while requiring less computational effort compared to conventional cnns and transformerbased architectures pruned qcnns achieve competitive performance with a reduced learnable parameter count and computational complexity on the audioset dataset pruned qcnns reduce computational cost by and parameter count by while maintaining performance comparable to the conventional cnns furthermore pruned qcnns generalize well across multiple audio classification benchmarks

ai authorship accountability and the role of humanai collaboration in research in this work we explored the use of patient specific reinforced learning to generate activity maps from two planar images anterior and posterior the solution of this problem remains unachievable using conventional methodologies and is of particular interest for dosimetry in nuclear medicine where approaches for posttherapy distribution of radiopharmaceuticals such as lupsma are typically done via either expensive and long spect acquisitions or fast yet only planar scintigraphy being able to generate activity maps from planar scintigraphy opens the gate for new dosimetry applications removing the need for spect and facilitating multitime point dosimetry studies our solution comprises the generation of a patient specific dataset with possible uptake maps of the radiopharmaceuticals withing the anatomy of the individual followed by an ai approach we explored both the use of dunet and diffusion models able to generate activity maps from planar images we have validated our method both in ulation and real planar acquisitions we observed enhanced results using patient specific reinforcement learning reduction on mae and increase in ssim and better organ delineation and patient anatomy especially when combining diffusion models with patient specific training yielding a ssim compared to the ground truth for ulations and when compared to a spect acquisition performed half an hour after the planar we believe that our methodology can set a change of paradigm for nuclear medicine dosimetry allowing for quantification using only planar scintigraphy without the need of expensive and timeconsuming spect leveraging the pretherapy information of the patients eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention shortterm intent and future actions making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior in this work we propose a gazeregularized framework that enhances vlms for two key egocentric understanding tasks finegrained future event prediction and current activity understanding unlike prior approaches that rely solely on visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal our method uses gaze only during training we introduce a gazeregularized attention mechanism that aligns model focus with human visual gaze this design is flexible and modular allowing it to generalize across multiple vlm architectures that utilize attention experimental results show that our approach improves semantic prediction scores by up to for future event prediction and around for current activity understanding compared to the corresponding baseline models trained without gaze regularization these results highlight the value of gazeguided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric vlms overall this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to enhance the predictive capabilities of vlms in realworld scenarios like assistive robots and humanmachine
