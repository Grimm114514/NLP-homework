we investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of listprocessing tasks in llms and we find that llms have learned to encode a compact causal representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic filter function of functional programming using causal mediation analysis on a diverse set of listprocessing tasks we find that a small number of attention heads which we dub filter heads encode a compact representation of the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens we demonstrate that this predicate representation is general and portable it can be extracted and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections presented in different formats languages or even in tasks however we also identify situations where transformer lms can exploit a different strategy for filtering eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations our results reveal that transformer lms can develop humaninterpretable implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways that are surprisingly ilar to strategies used in traditional functional programming patterns
as increasingly capable agents are deployed a central safety question is how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system we study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act autonomously play or defer ask while a human ultaneously chooses whether to be permissive trust or to engage in oversight oversee if the agent defers the humans choice determines the outcome potentially leading to a corrective action or a system shutdown we model this interaction as a twoplayer markov game our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies as a markov potential game mpg a class of games where we can provide an alignment guarantee under a structural assumption on the humans value function any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits itself cannot harm the humans value we also analyze extensions to this mpg framework theoretically this perspective provides conditions for a specific form of intrinsic alignment if the reward structures of the humanagent game meet these conditions we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its own outcome will not harm the humans practically this model motivates a transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to defer when risky and act when safe while its pretrained policy and the environments reward structure remain untouched our gridworld ulation shows that through independent learning the agent and human discover their optimal oversight roles the agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns when to oversee leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety violations introduced posttraining this demonstrates a practical method for making misaligned models safer after deployment

multimodal large language models mllms exhibit a pronounced preference for textual inputs when processing visionlanguage data limiting their ability to reason effectively from visual evidence unlike prior studies that attribute this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction tuning we propose that the bias originates from the models internal architecture specifically we hypothesize that visual key vectors visual keys are outofdistribution ood relative to the text key space learned during languageonly pretraining consequently these visual keys receive systematically lower ilarity scores during attention computation leading to their underutilization in the context representation to validate this hypothesis we extract key vectors from llava and qwenvl and analyze their distributional structures using qualitative tsne and quantitative jensenshannon divergence methods the results provide direct evidence that visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention space the intermodal divergence is statistically significant exceeding intramodal variation by several orders of magnitude these findings reveal that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key space rather than solely from external data factors
authorizing large language model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools and access protected resources introduces significant risks since current methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope we introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources and issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the agents assigned tasks given the unavailability of datasets centered on delegated authorization flows particularly including both semantically appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task we introduce astra a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes our experiments show both the potential and current limitations of modelbased matching particularly as the number of scopes needed for task completion increases our results highlight the need for further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intentaware authorization for multiagent and toolaugmented applications including finegrained control such as taskbased access control tbac
we envision a new era of ai termed agentic organization where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence to realize this vision we introduce asynchronous thinking asyncthink as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures specifically we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns subqueries to workers merges intermediate knowledge and produces coherent solutions more importantly the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning experiments demonstrate that asyncthink achieves lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning moreover asyncthink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training
normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic modality such as obligation and permission while large language models llms have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks their ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored in this paper we systematically evaluate llms reasoning capabilities in the normative domain from both logical and modal perspectives specifically to assess how well llms reason with normative modals we make a comparison between their reasoning with normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals which share a common formal structure to this end we introduce a new dataset covering a wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic domains while also incorporating nonformal cognitive factors that influence human reasoning our results indicate that although llms generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases ilar to those observed in psychological studies of human reasoning these findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in llms normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability all data and code are released publicly at
the electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in residential demand response capacity yet home energy management systems hems adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters while large language models have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter extractors no existing implementation deploys llms as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multiappliance scheduling this paper presents an agentic ai hems where llms autonomously coordinate multiappliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations a hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents uses the react pattern for iterative reasoning enabling dynamic coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating google calendar for contextaware deadline extraction evaluation across three opensource models using real austrian dayahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability differences llamab successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match costoptimal benchmarks computed via mixedinteger linear programming while other models achieve perfect singleappliance performance but struggle to coordinate all appliances ultaneously progressive prompt engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models general reasoning capabilities we opensource the complete system including orchestration logic agent prompts tools and web interfaces to enable reproducibility extension and future research

human feedback is critical for aligning ai systems to human values as ai capabilities improve and ai is used to tackle more challenging tasks verifying quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging this paper explores how we can leverage ai to improve the quality of human oversight we focus on an important safety problem that is already challenging for humans factverification of ai outputs we find that combining ai ratings and human ratings based on ai rater confidence is better than relying on either alone giving humans an ai factverification assistant further improves their accuracy but the type of assistance matters displaying ai explanation confidence and labels leads to overreliance but just showing search results and evidence fosters more appropriate trust these results have implications for amplified oversight the challenge of combining humans and ai to supervise ai systems even as they surpass human expert performance
karl marx once wrote that the human essence is the ensemble of social relations suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities within which contexts play a constitutive and essential role with the advent of computers and artificial intelligence these contexts are no longer limited to purely humanhuman interactions humanmachine interactions are included as well then a central question emerges how can machines better understand our situations and purposes to address this challenge researchers have recently introduced the concept of context engineering although it is often regarded as a recent innovation of the agent era we argue that related practices can be traced back more than twenty years since the early s the field has evolved through distinct historical phases each shaped by the intelligence level of machines from early humancomputer interaction frameworks built around primitive computers to todays humanagent interaction paradigms driven by intelligent agents and potentially to humanlevel or superhuman intelligence in the future in this paper we situate context engineering provide a systematic definition outline its historical and conceptual landscape and examine key design considerations for practice by addressing these questions we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context engineering and sketch its promising future this paper is a stepping stone for a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in ai systems
human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving making them difficult to analyze comprehensively legal case documents offer rich factual and procedural insights into these networks but are often long unstructured and filled with ambiguous or shifting references posing significant challenges for automated knowledge graph kg construction existing methods either overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking we propose linkkg a modular framework that integrates a threestage llmguided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream kg extraction at the core of our approach is a typespecific prompt cache which consistently tracks and resolves references across document chunks enabling clean and disambiguated narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long legal texts linkkg reduces average node duplication by and noisy nodes by compared to baseline methods resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures these improvements establish linkkg as a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks
large language models llms such as chatgpt are increasingly integrated into highstakes decisionmaking yet little is known about their susceptibility to social influence we conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with gpto in a hiring context in a baseline study gpt consistently favored the same candidate profile c reported moderate expertise m and high certainty m and rarely changed its choice in study gpt gpt faced unanimous opposition from eight ulated partners and almost always conformed reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated selfreported informational and normative conformity p in study gpt gpt interacted with a single partner and still conformed in of disagreement trials reporting less certainty and more normative conformity across studies results demonstrate that gpt does not act as an independent observer but adapts to perceived social consensus these findings highlight risks of treating llms as neutral decision aids and underline the need to elicit ai judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions
large reasoning models lrms achieve higher task performance by allocating more inferencetime compute and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may also strengthen safety by improving refusal yet we find the opposite the same reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards we introduce chainofthought hijacking a jailbreak attack on reasoning models the attack pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning across harmbench cot hijacking reaches a and attack success rate asr on gemini pro gpt o mini grok mini and claude sonnet respectively far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for lrms to understand the effectiveness of our attack we turn to a mechanistic analysis which shows that mid layers encode the strength of safety checking while late layers encode the verification outcome long benign cot dilutes both signals by shifting attention away from harmful tokens targeted ablations of attention heads identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal confirming their role in a safety subnetwork these results show that the most interpretable form of reasoning explicit cot can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined with finalanswer cues we release prompts outputs and judge decisions to facilitate replication

the emergence of agentic artificial intelligence ai is set to trigger a cambrian explosion of new kinds of personhood this paper proposes a pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood not as a metaphysical property to be discovered but as a flexible bundle of obligations rights and responsibilities that societies confer upon entities for a variety of reasons especially to solve concrete governance problems we argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled creating bespoke solutions for different contexts this will allow for the creation of practical tools such as facilitating ai contracting by creating a target individual that can be sanctioned without needing to resolve intractable debates about an ais consciousness or rationality we explore how individuals fit in to social roles and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology examining both personhood as a problem where design choices can create dark patterns that exploit human social heuristics and personhood as a solution where conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or prevent conflict by rejecting foundationalist quests for a single essential definition of personhood this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way to think about integrating ai agents into our society
the prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models llms on comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative data subsets ie tiny benchmarks that enable efficient assessment while retaining predictive fidelity current methods for this task operate under a modelcentric paradigm selecting benchmarking items based on the collective performance of existing models such approaches are limited by large upfront costs an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks coldstart and the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of their predecessors in this work we challenge this paradigm and propose a itemcentric approach to benchmark subset selection arguing that selection should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves rather than on modelspecific failure patterns we instantiate this itemcentric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method scales where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark samples empirically we show scales reduces the upfront selection cost by over x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity on the open llm leaderboard using just a data subset we predict full benchmark scores with a mean absolute error we demonstrate that this itemcentric approach enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation while also providing better coldstart performance and more interpretable benchmarking
artificial intelligence ai has demonstrated impressive progress in mathematical reasoning yet its integration into the practice of mathematical research remains limited in this study we investigate how the ai mathematician aim system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere problem solver focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory we analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of aim and incorporate targeted human interventions to structure the discovery process through iterative decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals selection of appropriate analytical methods and validation of intermediate results we reveal how human intuition and machine computation can complement one another this collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability transparency and interpretability of the resulting proofs while retaining human oversight for formal rigor and correctness the approach leads to a complete and verifiable proof and more broadly demonstrates how systematic humanai coreasoning can advance the frontier of mathematical discovery
reinforcement finetuning rft is a key technique for aligning large language models llms with human preferences and enhancing reasoning yet its effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training uniform task sampling is inefficient wasting computation on tasks that are either trivial or unsolvable while existing task selection methods often suffer from high rollout costs poor adaptivity or incomplete evidence we introduce bots a unified framework for bayesian online task selection in llm reinforcement finetuning grounded in bayesian inference bots adaptively maintains posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves it jointly incorporates explicit evidence from direct evaluations of selected tasks and implicit evidence inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks with thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and exploitation to make implicit evidence practical we instantiate it with an ultralight interpolationbased plugin that estimates difficulties of unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts adding negligible overhead empirically across diverse domains and llm scales bots consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations providing a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in rft
one approach to enhance monte carlo tree search mcts is to improve its sample efficiency by groupingabstracting states or stateaction pairs and sharing statistics within a group though stateaction pair abstractions are mostly easy to find in algorithms such as on the go abstractions in upper confidence bounds applied to trees ogauct nearly no state abstractions are found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining conditions we provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim and we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding many more abstractions we name this technique ideal pruning abstractions in uct ipauct which outperforms ogauct and any of its derivatives across a large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated ipauct uses a different abstraction framework from abstraction of stateaction pairs asap which is the one used by ogauct which we name ipa furthermore we show that both ipa and asap are special cases of a more general framework that we call pasap which itself is a special case of the asasap framework
compliance at web scale poses practical challenges each request may require a regulatory assessment regulatory texts eg the general data protection regulation gdpr are crossreferential and normative while runtime contexts are expressed in unstructured natural language this setting motivates us to align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured normative elements of regulations to this end we introduce graphcompliance a framework that represents regulatory texts as a policy graph and runtime contexts as a context graph and aligns them in this formulation the policy graph encodes normative structure and crossreferences whereas the context graph formalizes events as subjectactionobject sao and entityrelation triples this alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model llm in structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation and event parsing enabling a focus on the core reasoning step in experiments on gdprderived realworld scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks graphcompliance yields percentage points pp higher microf than llmonly and rag baselines with fewer under and overpredictions resulting in higher recall and lower false positive rates ablation studies indicate contributions from each graph component suggesting that structured representations and a judge llm are complementary for normative reasoning

recent video generation models can produce highfidelity temporally coherent videos indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge beyond realistic synthesis they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception modeling and manipulation yet an important question still remains are video models ready to serve as zeroshot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios in this work we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question focusing on the leading and popular veo we evaluate its reasoning behavior across dimensions including spatial geometric physical temporal and embodied logic systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes to standardize this study we curate the evaluation data into mmecof a compact benchmark that enables indepth and thorough assessment of chainofframe cof reasoning our findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on shorthorizon spatial coherence finegrained grounding and locally consistent dynamics they remain limited in longhorizon causal reasoning strict geometric constraints and abstract logic overall they are not yet reliable as standalone zeroshot reasoners but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models project page
as coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases the need to automatically design challenging codebaselevel evaluation is central we propose gistify a task where a coding llm must create a single minimal selfcontained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase the coding llm is given full access to a codebase along with a specific entrypoint eg a python command and the generated file must replicate the output of the same command ran under the full codebase while containing only the essential components necessary to execute the provided command success on gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase accurate modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially large code patches our findings show that current stateoftheart models struggle to reliably solve gistify tasks especially ones with long executions traces
reinforcement learning rl finetuning of large language models llms often suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and inference policies while prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments we show that its root cause lies in the floating point precision itself the widely adopted bf despite its large dynamic range introduces large rounding errors that breaks the consistency between training and inference in this work we demonstrate that ply reverting to fp effectively eliminates this mismatch the change is ple fully supported by modern frameworks with only a few lines of code change and requires no modification to the model architecture or learning algorithm our results suggest that using fp uniformly yields more stable optimization faster convergence and stronger performance across diverse tasks algorithms and frameworks we hope these findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision tradeoffs in rl finetuning

a world model is an internal model that ulates how the world evolves given past observations and actions it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think plan and reason effectively in complex dynamic settings despite rapid progress current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons we argue that a central cause is representation quality exteroceptive inputs eg images are highdimensional and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard we therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve worldmodel performance in this work we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic d world we propose geometricallyregularized world models grwm which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space this approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment grwm is plugandplay requires only minimal architectural modification scales with trajectory length and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones across deterministic d settings and longhorizon prediction tasks grwm significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure these findings support a clear takeaway improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models delivering reliable longhorizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module
we present amobench an advanced mathematical reasoning benchmark with olympiad level or even higher difficulty comprising humancrafted problems existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models llms however many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing toptier llms due to performance saturation eg aime to address this amobench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all problems are crossvalidated by experts to meet at least the international mathematical olympiad imo difficulty standards and entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization moreover each problem in amobench requires only a final answer rather than a proof enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation experimental results across llms on amobench show that even the bestperforming model achieves only accuracy on amobench with most llms scoring below beyond these poor performances our further analysis reveals a promising scaling trend with increasing testtime compute on amobench these results highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in current llms we release amobench to facilitate further research into advancing the reasoning abilities of language models
as llms occupy an increasingly important role in society they are more and more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems therefore studying the alignment of llms with human values has become a crucial field of inquiry prior work however mostly focuses on evaluating the alignment of fully trained models overlooking the training dynamics by which models learn to express human values in this work we investigate how and at which stage value alignment arises during the course of a models posttraining our analysis disentangles the effects of posttraining algorithms and datasets measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts during training experimenting with llama and qwen models of different sizes and popular supervised finetuning sft and preference optimization datasets and algorithms we find that the sft phase generally establishes a models values and subsequent preference optimization rarely realigns these values furthermore using a synthetic preference dataset that enables controlled manipulation of values we find that different preference optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes even when preference data is held constant our findings provide actionable insights into how values are learned during posttraining and help to inform data curation as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization to improve model alignment to human values
the endtoend label for llms is a misnomer in practice they depend on a nondifferentiable decoding process that requires laborious handtuning of hyperparameters like temperature and topp this paper introduces autodeco a novel architecture that enables truly endtoend generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy we augment the standard transformer with lightweight heads that at each step dynamically predict contextspecific temperature and topp values alongside the nexttoken logits this approach transforms decoding into a parametric tokenlevel process allowing the model to selfregulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks we demonstrate that autodeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracletuned baseline derived from hacking the test seta practical upper bound for any static method crucially we uncover an emergent capability for instructionbased decoding control the model learns to interpret natural language commands eg generate with low randomness and adjusts its predicted temperature and topp on a tokenbytoken basis opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive llm decoding

large language models llms have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across multiple domains by leveraging massive pretraining and curated finetuning data however in datasensitive fields such as healthcare the lack of highquality domainspecific training corpus hinders llms adaptation for specialized applications meanwhile domain experts have distilled domain wisdom into ontology rules which formalize relationships among concepts and ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories viewing llms as implicit repositories of human knowledge we propose evontree a novel framework that leverages a small set of highquality ontology rules to systematically extract validate and enhance domain knowledge within llms without requiring extensive external datasets specifically evontree extracts domain ontology from raw models detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules and reinforces the refined knowledge via selfdistilled finetuning extensive experiments on medical qa benchmarks with llamabinstruct and medv demonstrate consistent outperformance over both unmodified models and leading supervised baselines achieving up to a improvement in accuracy these results confirm the effectiveness efficiency and robustness of our approach for lowresource domain adaptation of llms
recent large language model llm research has undergone an architectural shift from encoderdecoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoderonly modeling this rapid transition however comes without a rigorous comparative analysis especially from the scaling perspective raising concerns that the potential of encoderdecoder models may have been overlooked to fill this gap we revisit encoderdecoder llm redllm enhancing it with recent recipes from decoderonly llm decllm we conduct a comprehensive comparison between redllm pretrained with prefix language modeling lm and decllm pretrained with causal lm at different model scales ranging from simm to simb using redpajama v t tokens for pretraining and flan for instruction tuning our experiments show that redllm produces compelling scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance while decllm is overall more computeoptimal during pretraining redllm demonstrates comparable scaling and context length extrapolation capabilities after instruction tuning redllm achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while enjoying substantially better inference efficiency we hope our findings could inspire more efforts on reexamining redllm unlocking its potential for developing powerful and efficient llms
multipage visual documents such as manuals brochures presentations and posters convey key information through layout colors icons and crossslide references while large language models llms offer opportunities in document understanding current systems struggle with complex multipage visual documents particularly in finegrained reasoning over elements and pages we introduce slideagent a versatile agentic framework for understanding multimodal multipage and multilayout documents especially slide decks slideagent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three specialized levelsglobal page and elementto construct a structured queryagnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and detailed visual or textual cues during inference slideagent selectively activates specialized agents for multilevel reasoning and integrates their outputs into coherent contextaware answers extensive experiments show that slideagent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary overall and opensource models overall
large language models llms face significant inference latency challenges stemming from their autoregressive design and large size to address this speculative decoding emerges as a solution enabling the ultaneous generation and validation of multiple tokens while recent approaches like eagle and eagle improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as gpu devices and batch sizes therefore we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called cast that takes into account inference costs including factors such as gpu configurations and batch sizes to dynamically refine the tree structure through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing six distinct llms our methodology demonstrates remarkable results achieving speeds up to times faster than conventional decoding methods moreover it generally outperforms existing stateoftheart techniques from to
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards rlvr is a promising approach for enhancing agentic deep search however its application is often hindered by low reward density in deep search scenarios where agents expend significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards in this paper we formalize this challenge as the reward density optimization problem which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of exploration cost this paper introduce infoflow a systematic framework that tackles this problem from three aspects subproblem decomposition breaking down longrange tasks to assign process rewards thereby providing denser learning signals failureguided hints injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the probability of successful outcomes dualagent refinement employing a dualagent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep exploration a refiner agent synthesizes the search history which effectively compresses the researchers perceived trajectory thereby reducing exploration cost and increasing the overall reward density we evaluate infoflow on multiple agentic search benchmarks where it significantly outperforms strong baselines enabling lightweight llms to achieve performance comparable to advanced proprietary llms
this paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in hernandez et al that decode specific relational facts in transformer language models we extend their singlerelation findings to a collection of relations and systematically chart their organization we show that such collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by ple order tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy to explain this surprising redundancy we develop a crossevaluation protocol in which we apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation our results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations but extract recurring coarsegrained semantic properties eg country of capital city and country of food are both in the countryofx property this propertycentric structure clarifies both the operators compressibility and highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically close our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer language models as primarily propertybased rather than relationspecific
diacritics restoration in hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning despite the languages high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized recent machine learning approaches have significantly advanced performance on this task in this work we present divrit a novel system for hebrew diacritization that frames the task as a zeroshot classification problem our approach operates at the word level selecting the most appropriate diacritization pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set conditioned on the surrounding textual context a key innovation of divrit is its use of a hebrew visual language model which processes undiacritized text as an image allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the inputs vector representation through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations we demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying on complex explicit linguistic analysis notably in an oracle setting where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided candidates divrit achieves a high level of accuracy furthermore strategic architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield significant improvements in the systems overall generalization capabilities these findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for accurate and automated hebrew diacritization
human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured lexically dense and filled with ambiguous or shifting references which pose significant challenges for automated knowledge graph kg construction while recent llmbased approaches improve over static templates they still generate noisy fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided extraction and coreference resolution the recently proposed corekg framework addresses these limitations by integrating a typeaware coreference module and domainguided structured prompts significantly reducing node duplication and legal noise in this work we present a systematic ablation study of corekg to quantify the individual contributions of its two key components our results show that removing coreference resolution results in a increase in node duplication and a increase in noisy nodes while removing structured prompts leads to a increase in node duplication and a increase in noisy nodes these findings offer empirical insights for designing robust llmbased pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex legal texts

while a multiagent approach based on large language models llms represents a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models its success is critically dependent on synergistic team composition however forming optimal teams is a significant challenge as the inherent opacity of most models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective collaboration in this paper we propose an interactioncentric framework for automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including their internal architectures training data or task performances our method constructs a language model graph that maps relationships between models from the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations and then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters our experiments with diverse llms demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent groups that reflect their latent specializations priming conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of manuallycurated teams based on known model specializations our findings provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multiagent llm teams
healthrelated misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful it is difficult to identify especially when claims distort or misinterpret scientific findings we investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and lightweight finetuning techniques on the ability of large language models llms to recognize fallacious arguments using the missci dataset and framework in this work we propose missynth a pipeline that applies retrievalaugmented generation rag to produce synthetic fallacy samples which are then used to finetune an llm model our results show substantial accuracy gains with finetuned models compared to vanilla baselines for instance the llama b finetuned model achieved an over fscore absolute improvement on the missci test split over its vanilla baseline we demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited annotated resources can significantly enhance zeroshot llm classification performance on realworld scientific misinformation tasks even with limited computational resources the code and synthetic dataset are available on

recent work has shown that different large language models llms converge to ilar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers these findings conflict with the documented propensity of llms to produce erroneous outputs when dealing with numeric information in this work we aim to explain this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms we find that despite surfacing errors different language models learn interchangeable representations of numbers that are systematic highly accurate and universal across their hidden states and the types of input contexts this allows us to create universal probes for each llm and to trace information including the causes of output errors to specific layers our results lay a fundamental understanding of how pretrained llms manipulate numbers and outline the potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of llms architectures
large language models llms commonly boost reasoning via sampleevaluateensemble decoders achieving label free gains without ground truth however prevailing strategies score candidates using only external outputs such as token probabilities entropies or self evaluations and these signals can be poorly calibrated after post training we instead analyze internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than incorrect ones throughout generation and activations from correct responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement whereas incorrect ones diverge motivated by these observations we propose neuron agreement decoding nad an unsupervised bestofn method that selects candidates using activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement operating solely on internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs nad enables early correctness prediction within the first generated tokens and supports aggressive early stopping across math and science benchmarks with verifiable answers nad matches majority voting on open ended coding benchmarks where majority voting is inapplicable nad consistently outperforms avg by pruning unpromising trajectories early nad reduces token usage by with minimal loss in generation quality showing that internal signals provide reliable scalable and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding

throughout language history words are borrowed from one language to another and gradually become integrated into the recipients lexicon speakers can often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary particularly in bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical items on a minority language this paper investigates whether pretrained language models including large language models possess ilar capabilities for loanword identification we evaluate multiple models across languages despite explicit instructions and contextual information our results show that models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones these findings corroborate previous evidence that modern nlp systems exhibit a bias toward loanwords rather than native equivalents our work has implications for developing nlp tools for minority languages and supporting language preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages
the ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in human communication and language use and language models are also expected to possess this capability this study demonstrates that providing language models with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective incontext learning approach for tasks to understand implied meanings specifically we propose an approach in which an overview of pragmatic theories such as gricean pragmatics and relevance theory is presented as a prompt to the language model guiding it through a stepbystep reasoning process to derive a final interpretation experimental results showed that compared to the baseline which prompts intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories shot chainofthought our methods enabled language models to achieve up to higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks furthermore we show that even without explaining the details of pragmatic theories merely mentioning their names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement around in larger models compared to the baseline
retrievalaugmented generation rag has emerged as a leading approach to reducing hallucinations in large language models llms current rag evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local rag retrieving relevant chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only localized understanding within specific text chunks however many realworld applications require a fundamentally different capability global rag which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document collections to derive corpuslevel insights for example what are the top most cited papers in in this paper we introduce globalqa the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global rag capabilities covering four core task types counting extremum queries sorting and topk extraction through systematic evaluation across different models and baselines we find that existing rag methods perform poorly on global tasks with the strongest baseline achieving only f score to address these challenges we propose globalrag a multitool collaborative framework that preserves structural coherence through chunklevel retrieval incorporates llmdriven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents and integrates aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation on the qwenb model globalrag achieves f compared to the strongest baselines f validating the effectiveness of our method
human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable ways as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data encodes while prior work studies preferences over certain attributes eg length or sycophancy automatically extracting relevant features without prespecifying hypotheses remains challenging we introduce whats in my human feedback wimhf a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders wimhf characterizes both the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring and the preferences that the annotators actually express across datasets wimhf identifies a small number of humaninterpretable features that account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by blackbox models these features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer and the role of datasetlevel context for example users on reddit prefer informality and jokes while annotators in hhrlhf and prism disprefer them wimhf also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences such as that lmarena users tend to vote against refusals often in favor of toxic content the learned features enable effective data curation relabeling the harmful examples in arena yields large safety gains with no cost to general performance they also allow finegrained personalization on the community alignment dataset we learn annotatorspecific weights over subjective features that improve preference prediction wimhf provides a humancentered analysis method for practitioners to better understand and use preference data
while diffusion language models dlms enable finegrained refinement their practical controllability remains fragile we identify and formally characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting in which uniform and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement process thereby degrading fluency and coherence as this failure originates in uniform and context agnostic updates effective control demands explicit token ordering we propose token timestep allocation tta which realizes soft and semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules critical tokens are frozen early while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement this timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an adaptive policy driven by task signals thereby supporting a broad spectrum of refinement strategies because it operates purely at inference time it applies uniformly across various dlms and naturally extends to diverse supervision sources empirically tta improves controllability and fluency on sentiment control it yields more than percent higher accuracy and nearly halves perplexity using less than one fifth the steps in detoxification it lowers maximum toxicity versus and perplexity versus together these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable and controllable diffusion text generation

crosslingual alignment cla aims to align multilingual representations enabling large language models llms to seamlessly transfer knowledge across languages while intuitive we hypothesize this pursuit of representational convergence can inadvertently cause cultural erasure the functional loss of providing culturallysituated responses that should diverge based on the query language in this work we systematically analyze this tradeoff by introducing a holistic evaluation framework the transferlocalization plane which quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure using this framework we reevaluate recent cla approaches and find that they consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural localization across all six languages studied our investigation into the internal representations of these models reveals a key insight universal factual transfer and culturallyspecific knowledge are optimally steerable at different model layers based on this finding we propose surgical steering a novel inferencetime method that disentangles these two objectives by applying targeted activation steering to distinct layers our approach achieves a better balance between the two competing dimensions effectively overcoming the limitations of current alignment techniques
current tooluse large language models llms are trained on static datasets enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multistep toolintegrated reasoning which produces toolcall trajectories however these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic toolcall routine thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited performance in an evolved dynamic toolcall environment in this work we propose portool a reinforcement learning rl method that encourages a tooluse llm to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer specifically this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given query and some of them share the first few toolcall steps thereby forming a treelike structure next we assign rewards to each step based on its ability to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls a shared step across different trajectories receives the same reward while different steps under the same fork receive different rewards finally these stepwise rewards are used to calculate forkrelative advantages blended with trajectoryrelative advantages to train the llm for tool use the experiments utilize tools to address user queries covering both timesensitive and timeinvariant topics we conduct ablation studies to systematically justify the necessity and the design robustness of stepwise rewards furthermore we compare the proposed portool with other training approaches and demonstrate significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of toolcall steps
large language models llms often struggle with problems that require multistep reasoning for smallscale opensource models reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards rlvr fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts while supervised finetuning sft tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid tokenbytoken imitation to address this gap we propose supervised reinforcement learning srl a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical actions srl trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action it provides smoother rewards based on the ilarity between the models actions and expert actions extracted from the sft dataset in a stepwise manner this supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations as a result srl enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by sft or rlvr moreover initializing training with srl before refining with rlvr yields the strongest overall performance beyond reasoning benchmarks srl generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoningoriented llms
large language models llms are widely used in generative applications such as chatting code generation and reasoning however many realworld workloads such as classification question answering recommendation and text embedding rely solely on the prefill stage of inference where the model encodes input sequences without performing autoregressive decoding in these prefill only scenarios the selfattention computation becomes the primary performance bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length in this paper we observe that semantically different sentences often produce ilar attention maps across layers and heads building on this insight we propose attncache a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of llm inference by retrieving and reusing ilar attention maps based on an attention map memorization database attncache employs efficient caching and ilarity search techniques to identify and reuse precached attention maps during inference thereby reducing the computational overhead of selfattention experimental results show that attncache achieves an average of x endtoend and x attention speedup on cpu and x endtoend and x attention speedup on gpu with negligible accuracy degradation
ai accelerators customized to ai workloads provide costeffective and highperformance solutions for training and inference trainium an ai accelerator recently developed by amazon web services aws provides an attractive option for llm training and inference through its heterogeneous architecture however leveraging trainium architecture for high performance can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special requirement on data layout in this paper we design highperformance matrix multiplication matmul a critical compute kernel for llm inference on trainium we introduce a series of techniques customized to trainium based on kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the softwaremanaged memory hierarchy maximize sram bandwidth and avoid expensive matrix transpose evaluating with nine datasets and four recent llms we show that our system largely outperforms the stateoftheart matmul implemented by aws on trainium at the level of matmul kernel it achieves an average x speedup up to x which translates to an average x speedup up to x for endtoend llm inference
large language models llms often struggle with complex mathematical reasoning where prosebased generation leads to unverified and arithmetically unsound solutions current prompting strategies like chain of thought still operate within this unreliable medium lacking a mechanism for deterministic verification to address these limitations we introduce symcode a neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problemsolving as a task of verifiable code generation using the sympy library we evaluate symcode on challenging benchmarks including math and olympiadbench demonstrating significant accuracy improvements of up to percentage points over baselines our analysis shows that symcode is not only more tokenefficient but also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards transparent programmatic errors by grounding llm reasoning in a deterministic symbolic engine symcode represents a key step towards more accurate and trustworthy ai in formal domains
machine translation mt is widely employed to address resource scarcity in lowresource languages by generating synthetic data from highresource counterparts while sentiment preservation in translation has long been studied a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment between source and target languages in this paper we hypothesize that semantic labels are drifted or altered during mt due to cultural divergence through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains we establish three key findings mt systems including modern large language models llms induce label drift during translation particularly in culturally sensitive domains unlike earlier statistical mt tools llms encode cultural knowledge and leveraging this knowledge can amplify label drift and cultural ilarity or dissimilarity between source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation our findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in mt not only undermines label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in downstream applications
the impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large language models llms has been a topic of ongoing debate often raising concerns about potential tradeoffs between language coverage and model performance ie the curse of multilinguality in this work we investigate these assumptions by training b and b parameter llms on diverse multilingual corpora varying the number of languages from to our study challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training first we find that combining english and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the inlanguage performance of either group provided that languages have a sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus second we observe that using english as a pivot language ie a highresource language that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization yields benefits across language families and contrary to expectations selecting a pivot language from within a specific family does not consistently improve performance for languages within that family lastly we do not observe a significant curse of multilinguality as the number of training languages increases in models at this scale our findings suggest that multilingual data when balanced appropriately can enhance language model capabilities without compromising performance even in lowresource settings
if we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model llm how can we ever know what it has seen we believe the most compelling evidence arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content as such we propose recap an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized training data from llm outputs at the heart of recap is a feedbackdriven loop where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language model which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies discrepancies these are then translated into minimal correction hints which are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations in addition to address alignmentinduced refusals recap includes a jailbreaking module that detects and overcomes such barriers we evaluate recap on echotrace a new benchmark spanning over full books and the results show that recap leads to substantial gains over singleiteration approaches for instance with gpt the average rougel score for the copyrighted text extraction improved from to a nearly increase

posttraining of large language models llms is crucial for unlocking their task generalization potential and domainspecific capabilities however the current llm posttraining paradigm faces significant data challenges including the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data scales therefore achieving dataefficient posttraining has become a key research question in this paper we present the first systematic survey of dataefficient llm posttraining from a datacentric perspective we propose a taxonomy of dataefficient llm posttraining methods covering data selection data quality enhancement synthetic data generation data distillation and compression and selfevolving data ecosystems we summarize representative approaches in each category and outline future research directions by examining the challenges in dataefficient llm posttraining we highlight open problems and propose potential research avenues we hope our work inspires further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in largescale model training paper list

in artificial intelligence ai alignment research instrumental goals also called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals are widely associated with advanced ai systems these goals which include tendencies such as powerseeking and selfpreservation become problematic when they conflict with human aims conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward hacking or goal misgeneralization and attempts to limit the symptoms of instrumental goals notably resource acquisition and selfpreservation this article proposes an alternative framing that a philosophical argument can be constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited drawing on aristotles ontology and its modern interpretations an ontology of concrete goaldirected entities it argues that advanced ai systems can be seen as artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct from their designers intentions in this view the instrumental tendencies of such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than accidental malfunctions the implication is that efforts should focus less on eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding managing and directing them toward humanaligned ends

a core challenge of monte carlo tree search mcts is its sample efficiency which can be improved by grouping stateaction pairs and using their aggregate statistics instead of singlenode statistics on the go abstractions in upper confidence bounds applied to trees ogauct is the stateoftheart mcts abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its abstraction using the abstractions of stateaction pairs asap framework which aims to detect states and stateaction pairs with the same value under optimal play by analysing the search graph asap however requires two stateaction pairs to have the same immediate reward which is a rigid condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby the sample efficiency in this paper we break with the paradigm of grouping valueequivalent states or stateaction pairs and instead group states and stateaction pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference between their values can be inferred we call this abstraction framework known value difference abstractions kvda which infers the value differences by analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies ogauct to use this framework instead the modification is called kvdauct which detects significantly more abstractions than ogauct introduces no additional parameter and outperforms ogauct on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings

neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energyconstrained robotics by achieving ordersofmagnitude efficiency gains while enabling native temporal processing spiking neural networks snns represent a promising algorithmic approach for these systems yet their application to complex control tasks faces two critical challenges the nondifferentiable nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear optimization properties and the stateful dynamics of snns require training on sequences which in reinforcement learning rl is hindered by limited sequence lengths during early training preventing the network from bridging its warmup period we address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient slope settings showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients in supervised learning we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes the effect is much more pronounced in rl settings where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead to a x improvement in both training and final deployed performance next we propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to bootstrap the learning process while still exploiting online environment interactions with the spiking policy combining our method with an adaptive slope schedule for a realworld drone position control task we achieve an average return of points substantially outperforming prior techniques including behavioral cloning and tdbc which achieve at most points under the same conditions this work advances both the theoretical understanding of surrogate gradient learning in snns and practical training methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in realworld robotic systems
the autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that defines their digital environment such as the document object model dom of web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services however constructing this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges the verbosity of raw html makes it computationally intractable for direct use by foundation models while the static nature of hardcoded api integrations prevents agents from adapting to evolving services this paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured data presenting two complementary architectural patterns the dom transduction pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling a verbose raw dom into a compact taskrelevant representation or world model optimized for an agents reasoning core concurrently the hypermedia affordances recognition pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime together these patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently construct and maintain an accurate world model enabling scalable adaptive and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources

judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events based on human judgment this task can be seen as a form of claim verification where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the plausibility of that event in this paper we propose a novel multiagent framework for claim verification whereby different agents may disagree on claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks qbafs we then instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification with a variety of agents realised with large language models llms argllm agents an existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates qbafs rbam agents whereby llmempowered relationbased argument mining rbam from external sources is used to generate qbafs ragargllm agents extending argllm agents with a form of retrievalaugmented generation rag of arguments from external sources finally we conduct experiments with two standard judgmental forecasting datasets with instances of our framework with two or three agents empowered by six different base llms we observe that combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy especially in the case of three agents while providing an explainable combination of evidence for claim verification

one weakness of monte carlo tree search mcts is its sample efficiency which can be addressed by building and using state andor action abstractions in parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of the same layer the primary usage of abstractions for mcts is to enhance the upper confidence bound ucb value during the tree policy by aggregating visits and returns of an abstract node however this direct usage of abstractions does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent might be in the same abstract node as these would then all have the same ucb value thus requiring a tiebreak rule in stateoftheart abstraction algorithms such as pruned on the go abstractions pruned oga this case has not been noticed and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen in this paper we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative intraabstraction policies several of which outperform the random policy across a majority of environments and parameter settings

crossdomain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web applications despite its rapid advancement achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge existing methods have made progress by extending singledomain models yet often fall short when facing domainspecific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns we argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components to address this we propose onecast a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components each modeled through tailored generative pathways specifically the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions in parallel the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semanticaware tokenizer and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism the outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domainspecific trends extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that onecast mostly outperforms stateoftheart baselines

tandem mass spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in crucial fields such as metabolomics natural product discovery and environmental analysis however current methods rely on database matching from previously observed molecules or on multistep pipelines that require intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction this makes finding the correct molecule highly challenging particularly for compounds absent from reference databases we introduce a framework that by leveraging testtime tuning enhances the learning of a pretrained transformer model to address this gap enabling endtoend de novo molecular structure generation directly from the tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae bypassing manual annotations and intermediate steps we surpass the defacto stateoftheart approach diffms on two popular benchmarks nplib and massspecgym by and respectively testtime tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt to novel spectra and the relative performance gain over conventional finetuning is of on massspecgym when predictions deviate from the ground truth the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable identification
multienvironment pomdps mepomdps extend standard pomdps with discrete model uncertainty mepomdps represent a finite set of pomdps that share the same state action and observation spaces but may arbitrarily vary in their transition observation and reward models such models arise for instance when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem the goal is to find a single policy that is robust against any choice of pomdp within the set ie a policy that maximizes the worstcase reward across all pomdps we generalize and expand on existing work in the following way first we show that mepomdps can be generalized to pomdps with sets of initial beliefs which we call adversarialbelief pomdps abpomdps second we show that any arbitrary mepomdp can be reduced to a mepomdp that only varies in its transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward functions while preserving optimal policies we then devise exact and imate pointbased algorithms to compute robust policies for abpomdps and thus mepomdps we demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard pomdp benchmarks extended to the multienvironment setting

object binding the brains ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole is central to human cognition it groups lowlevel perceptual features into highlevel object representations stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory and supports human reasoning about individual object instances while prior work often imposes objectcentric attention eg slot attention explicitly to probe these benefits it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pretrained vision transformers vits intuitively they could recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention motivated by the quadratic nature of selfattention we hypothesize that vits represent whether two patches belong to the same object a property we term issameobject we decode issameobject from patch embeddings across vit layers using a ilarity probe which reaches over accuracy crucially this objectbinding capability emerges reliably in selfsupervised vits dino mae clip but markedly weaker in imagenetsupervised models suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives we further discover that issameobject is encoded in a lowdimensional subspace on top of object features and that this signal actively guides attention ablating issameobject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective our findings challenge the view that vits lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of which parts belong together emerges naturally in a connectionist system

realworld tasks require decisions at varying granularities and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a highlevel form of action however current large language model llmbased agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities this limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between highlevel planning and lowlevel action which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization we propose recode recursive code generation a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation in this representation recode treats highlevel plans as abstract placeholder functions which the agent then recursively decomposes into finergrained subfunctions until reaching primitive actions this recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity furthermore the recursive structure inherently generates rich multigranularity training data enabling models to learn hierarchical decisionmaking processes extensive experiments show recode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control the code is available at

designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important and longstanding challenge in recent years a wide range of solutions have been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning including neurosymbolic approaches variants of the transformer architecture and specialised graph neural networks however existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly plified setting based on the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths in fact this assumption is hardbaked into the architecture of several recent models leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but are difficult to generalise to other settings to support further progress in the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks we introduce nora a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires models to go beyond pathbased reasoning

adaptive agent design offers a way to improve humanai collaboration on timesensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments in such cases to ensure the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements an assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most effectively given that human attention represents a zerosum cognitive resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming information we introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication formalised as bayesian reference resolution using the rational speech act rsa modelling framework to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment the agent adapts message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based on projections of how priorguided interpretation of messages will influence attention to the interface and subsequent belief update across several timesteps out to a fixed horizon in a comparison to baseline methods we show that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multistep planning with a realistic model of user awareness as the first application of rsa for communication in a dynamic environment and for humanai interaction in general we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in humanagent teams highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents

we introduce a novel dropin modification to monte carlo tree searchs mcts decision policy that we call aupo comparisons based on a range of ippc benchmark problems show that aupo clearly outperforms mcts aupo is an automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward distribution statistics acquired during the mcts thus unlike other automatic abstraction algorithms aupo requires neither access to transition probabilities nor does aupo require a directed acyclic search graph to build its abstraction allowing aupo to detect symmetric actions that stateoftheart frameworks like asap struggle with when the resulting symmetric states are far apart in state space furthermore as aupo only affects the decision policy it is not mutually exclusive with other abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search
learning diverse skills without handcrafted reward functions could accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks however existing skill discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without considering human preferences which leads to undesirable behaviors and possibly dangerous skills for instance a cheetah robot trained using previous methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity whereas we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas in this work we propose a foundation model guided fog skill discovery method which incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models specifically fog extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate states based on human intentions assigning higher values to desirable states and lower to undesirable ones these scores are then used to reweight the rewards of skill discovery algorithms by optimizing the reweighted skill discovery rewards fog successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors such as flipping or rolling and to avoid hazardous areas in both statebased and pixelbased tasks interestingly we show that fog can discover skills involving behaviors that are difficult to define interactive visualisations are available from
scientific large language models scillms have emerged as a promising frontier for accelerating biological discovery however these models face a fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences the tokenization dilemma whether treating sequences as a specialized language risking the loss of functional motif information or as a separate modality introducing formidable alignment challenges current strategies fundamentally limit their reasoning capacity we challenge this sequencecentric paradigm by positing that a more effective strategy is to provide scillms with highlevel structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools thereby bypassing the need to interpret lowlevel noisy sequence data directly through a systematic comparison of leading scillms on biological reasoning tasks we tested three input modes sequenceonly contextonly and a combination of both our findings are striking the contextonly approach consistently and substantially outperforms all other modes even more revealing the inclusion of the raw sequence alongside its highlevel context consistently degrades performance indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise even for models with specialized tokenization schemes these results suggest that the primary strength of existing scillms lies not in their nascent ability to interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch but in their profound capacity for reasoning over structured humanreadable knowledge therefore we argue for reframing scillms not as sequence decoders but as powerful reasoning engines over expert knowledge this work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid scientific ai agents repositioning the developmental focus from direct sequence interpretation towards highlevel knowledge synthesis the code is available at

background trustworthy ai serves as a foundational pillar for two major ai ethics conferences aies and facct however current research often adopts technocentric approaches focusing primarily on technical attributes such as reliability robustness and fairness while overlooking the sociotechnical dimensions critical to understanding ai trustworthiness in realworld contexts objectives this scoping review aims to examine how the aies and facct communities conceptualize measure and validate ai trustworthiness identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding of trustworthy ai systems methods we conduct a scoping review of aies and facct conference proceedings to date systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined operationalized and applied across different research domains our analysis focuses on conceptualization approaches measurement methods verification and validation techniques application areas and underlying values results while significant progress has been made in defining technical attributes such as transparency accountability and robustness our findings reveal critical gaps current research often predominantly asizes technical precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations the sociotechnical nature of ai systems remains less explored and trustworthiness emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it conclusions an interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with social cultural and institutional considerations is essential for advancing trustworthy ai we propose actionable measures for the ai ethics community to adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between ai systems and society ultimately promoting responsible technological development that benefits all stakeholders

diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions this capability has driven their application to highdimensional multiobjective blackbox optimization problem existing approaches often employ an external optimization loop such as an evolutionary algorithm to the diffusion model however these approaches treat the diffusion model as a blackbox refiner which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the diffusion generation process limiting their efficiency to address these challenges we propose the inferencetime multitarget generation img algorithm which optimizes the diffusion process at inferencetime to generate samples that ultaneously satisfy multiple objectives specifically our img performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according to the expected aggregated multiobjective values this weighted resampling strategy ensures the diffusiongenerated samples are distributed according to our desired multitarget boltzmann distribution we further derive that the multitarget boltzmann distribution has an interesting loglikelihood interpretation where it is the optimal solution to the distributional multiobjective optimization problem we implemented img for a multiobjective molecule generation task experiments show that img requiring only a single generation pass achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations notably our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance

incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments in this paper we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery termed interventional constraints which differs fundamentally from interventional data while interventional data require direct perturbations of variables interventional constraints encode highlevel causal knowledge in the form of inequality constraints on causal effects for instance in the sachs dataset sachs et al akt has been shown to be activated by pip meaning pip exerts a positive causal effect on akt existing causal discovery methods allow enforcing structural constraints for example requiring a causal path from pip to akt but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as learning that pip inhibits akt interventional constraints bridge this gap by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs ensuring learned models respect known causal influences to formalize interventional constraints we propose a metric to quantify total causal effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained optimization task solved using a twostage constrained optimization method we evaluate our approach on realworld datasets and demonstrate that integrating interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures consistency with established findings making models more explainable but also facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be costly to identify

developing trustworthy machine learning ml models requires their predicted probabilities to be wellcalibrated meaning they should reflect trueclass frequencies among calibration notions in multiclass classification strong calibration is the most stringent as it requires all predicted probabilities to be ultaneously calibrated across all classes however existing approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias predictions in sparse regions of the feature space are systematically miscalibrated this is especially relevant in highstakes settings such as healthcare where the sparse instances are exactly those most at risk of biased treatment in this work we address this main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration first we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its relationship with strong calibration second we theoretically analyze the pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local calibration third we propose a practical method for enhancing local calibration in neural networks which enforces alignment between predicted probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the jensenshannon distance finally we empirically validate our approach against existing multiclass calibration techniques

machine unlearning mu aims to remove the influence of certain data points from a trained model without costly retraining most practical mu algorithms are only imate and their performance can only be assessed empirically care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as possible a common practice is to run the mu algorithm multiple times independently starting from the same trained model in this work we demonstrate that this practice can give highly nonrepresentative results because even for the same architecture and same dataset some mu methods can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model training we therefore recommend that empirical comphttpsinfo of mu algorithms should also reflect the variability across different model training seeds

the expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the constrained memory capacity of modern gpus to mitigate this mixtureofexperts moe architectures activate only a small portion of parameters during inference significantly lowering both memory demand and computational overhead however conventional moe inference approaches which select active experts independently at each layer often introduce considerable latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and gpu memory in addition current crosslayer prediction strategies which are typically based on fixed steps lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and workloads thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness to address these challenges we present expertflow a runtime system for moe inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cacheaware routing expertflow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth parameter dimensionality and model feedback signals furthermore it incorporates a hybrid crosslayer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs by adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage behavior expertflow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency caused by expert swapins our evaluation demonstrates that expertflow reduces model stall time to less than of the baseline highlighting its capability to optimize moe inference under stringent memory constraints

in sequence modeling the parametric memory of atomic facts has been predominantly abstracted as a bruteforce lookup of cooccurrences between entities we contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how memory is stored we begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of the local cooccurrences specified during training instead the model must have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts encoding global relationships between all entities including noncooccurring ones this in turn has plified a hard reasoning task involving an ellfold composition into an easytolearn step geometric task from this phenomenon we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain we argue that the rise of such a geometry despite optimizing over mere local associations cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures counterintuitively an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more succinct than a bruteforce lookup of associations then by analyzing a connection to nodevec we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that in contrast to prevailing theories indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures this analysis also points to practitioners a visible headroom to make transformer memory more strongly geometric we hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition capacity discovery and unlearning
quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency power and memory footprint of generative ai models however accuracy often degrades sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits recent work suggests that invertible linear transformations eg rotations can aid quantization by reparameterizing feature channels and weights in this paper we propose sequence transformation and mixed precision stamp quantization a novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the sequence dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data by keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher precision we can maintain model accuracy at lower average activations bitwidths we evaluate stamp on recent lvm and llm architectures demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization methods including recent feature transformations
how can we explain the influence of training data on blackbox models influence functions ifs offer a posthoc solution by utilizing gradients and hessians however computing the hessian for an entire dataset is resourceintensive necessitating a feasible alternative a common approach involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data but this method often results in highly inconsistent if estimates due to the high variance in sample configurations to address this we propose two advanced sampling techniques based on features and logits these samplers select a small yet representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic distribution of features or logits thereby enhancing the accuracy of if estimations we validate our approach through class removal experiments a typical application of ifs using the fscore to measure how effectively the model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the remaining classes our method reduces computation time by and memory usage by or improves the fscore by compared to the baseline

agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics which are coarse rely on manual design from experts and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors we propose autolibra a framework for agent evaluation that transforms openended human feedback eg if you find that the button is disabled dont click it again or this agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own into metrics for evaluating finegrained behaviors in agent trajectories autolibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agents behavior clustering ilar positive and negative behaviors and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples which can be used for prompting llmasajudge as evaluators we further propose two meta metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of induced metrics with open feedback coverage and redundancy through optimizing these metametrics we experimentally demonstrate autolibras ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents we also present two applications of autolibra in agent improvement first we show that autolibra serve human prompt engineers for diagonalize agent failures and improve prompts iterative moreover we find that autolibra can induce metrics for automatic optimization for agents which makes agents improve through selfregulation our results suggest that autolibra is a powerful taskagnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents
agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations and act to influence future observations this latter capacity is captured by empowerment which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial intelligence and cognitive science this former capacity however is equally foundational in what ways and to what extent can an agent be influenced by what it observes in this paper we ground this concept in a universal agentcentric measure that we refer to as plasticity and reveal a fundamental connection to empowerment following a set of desiderata on a suitable definition we define plasticity using a new informationtheoretic quantity we call the generalized directed information we show that this new quantity strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by massey while preserving all of its desirable properties under this definition we find that plasticity is well thought of as the mirror of empowerment the two concepts are defined using the same measure with only the direction of influence reversed our main result establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics we explore the implications of these findings and suggest that plasticity empowerment and their relationship are essential to understanding agency

reinforcement learning rl has proven effective for finetuning large language models llms significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation a crucial factor influencing rl finetuning success is the training curriculum the order in which training problems are presented while random curricula serve as common baselines they remain suboptimal manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive to address these limitations we propose selfevolving curriculum sec an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the rl finetuning process our approach formulates curriculum selection as a nonstationary multiarmed bandit problem treating each problem category eg difficulty level or problem type as an individual arm we leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain at each training step the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the td method across three distinct reasoning domains planning inductive reasoning and mathematics our experiments demonstrate that sec significantly improves models reasoning capabilities enabling better generalization to harder outofdistribution test problems additionally our approach achieves better skill balance when finetuning ultaneously on multiple reasoning domains these findings highlight sec as a promising strategy for rl finetuning of llms
this position paper argues that the theoretical inconsistency often observed among responsible ai rai metrics such as differing fairness definitions or tradeoffs between accuracy and privacy should be embraced as a valuable feature rather than a flaw to be eliminated we contend that navigating these inconsistencies by treating metrics as divergent objectives yields three key benefits normative pluralism maintaining a full suite of potentially contradictory metrics ensures that the diverse moral stances and stakeholder values inherent in rai are adequately represented epistemological completeness the use of multiple sometimes conflicting metrics allows for a more comprehensive capture of multifaceted ethical concepts thereby preserving greater informational fidelity about these concepts than any single plified definition implicit regularization jointly optimizing for theoretically conflicting objectives discourages overfitting to one specific metric steering models towards solutions with enhanced generalization and robustness under realworld complexities in contrast efforts to enforce theoretical consistency by plifying or pruning metrics risk narrowing this value diversity losing conceptual depth and degrading model performance we therefore advocate for a shift in rai theory and practice from getting trapped in inconsistency to characterizing acceptable inconsistency thresholds and elucidating the mechanisms that permit robust imated consistency in practice
language interpretation is a compositional process in which the meaning of more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to sparql queries an open question is how systematic this interpretation process is toward this question in this paper we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of llms to interpret questions are actually compositional for this we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in dbpedia relying on lemon lexica for verbalization our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of llms to interpret structurally complex questions given that they have seen the atomic building blocks this allows us to evaluate to what degree llms are able to interpret complex questions for which they understand the atomic parts we conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and fewshot optimization techniques as well as finetuning our results show that performance in terms of macro f degrades from over down to with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input the f scores do not exceed for the dataset of lowest complexity we thus conclude that llms struggle to systematically and compositionally interpret questions and map them into sparql queries
large language models llms have demonstrated remarkable progress through preferencebased finetuning which critically depends on the quality of the underlying training data while human feedback is essential for improving data quality it is costly and does not scale well in this paper we introduce refinenjudge an automated iterative approach that leverages a single llm as both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality unlike existing iterative refinement methods refinenjudge employs an llm to both generate refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement ensuring that every iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human annotation or a separate reward model at each step the llm refines a response and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer this process continues until the llm prefers the initial answer over the refinement indicating no further improvements this produces sequences of increasing quality preferencelabeled responses ideal for finetuning we demonstrate the effectiveness of refinenjudge across a range of public datasets spanning five corpora targeting tasks such as coding math and conversation models llama b and llama b finetuned on refinenjudgeenhanced datasets were preferred by llm judges in over of comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by gpt additionally we report performance gains on alpacaeval and alpacaeval and on mtbench our results indicate that refinenjudge produces highquality datasets and scalable model improvements

recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of large language models llms contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss however such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior in this work we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions including evaluation protocols task categories and model architectures our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting under likelihoodbased metrics without generation pruning most layers preserves performance with only the initial few being critical by contrast generationbased evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining longrange coherence we further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers yet can be reshaped through distillation these results highlight that depth usage in llms is highly heterogeneous and contextdependent underscoring the need for task metric and modelaware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models
there is a growing interest in universal multimodal embeddings ume where models are required to generate taskspecific representations while recent studies show that multimodal large language models mllms perform well on such tasks they treat mllms solely as encoders overlooking their generative capacity however such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning inspired by the proven effectiveness of chainofthought reasoning we propose a general thinkthenembed tte framework for ume composed of a reasoner and an embedder the reasoner mllm first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning this explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions our contributions are threefold first by leveraging a powerful mllm reasoner we achieve stateoftheart performance on the mmebv benchmark surpassing proprietary models trained on massive inhouse datasets second to reduce the dependency on large mllm reasoners we finetune a smaller mllm reasoner using highquality embeddingcentric reasoning traces achieving the best performance among opensource models with a absolute gain over recently proposed models third we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance

large language models llms have shown great promise in automating data analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating multioperation execution plans however existing llmagentbased analytics frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access offering little to no privacy protection in contrast federated analytics fa enables privacypreserving computation across distributed data sources but lacks support for natural language input and requires structured machinereadable queries in this work we present lafa the first system that integrates llmagentbased data analytics with fa lafa introduces a hierarchical multiagent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms them into optimized executable fa workflows a coarsegrained planner first decomposes complex queries into subqueries while a finegrained planner maps each subquery into a directed acyclic graph of fa operations using prior structural knowledge to improve execution efficiency an optimizer agent rewrites and merges multiple dags eliminating redundant operations and minimizing computational and communicational overhead our experiments demonstrate that lafa consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resourceintensive fa operations by a substantial margin this work establishes a practical foundation for privacypreserving llmdriven analytics that supports natural language input in the fa setting

the extraordinary capabilities of large language models llms such as chatgpt and gpt are in part unleashed by aligning them with reward models that are trained on human preferences which are often represented as rankings of responses to prompts in this paper we document the phenomenon of reward collapse an empirical observation where the prevailing rankingbased approach results in an identical reward distribution regardless of the prompts during the terminal phase of training this outcome is undesirable as openended prompts like write a short story about your best friend should yield a continuous range of rewards for their completions while specific prompts like what is the capital of new zealand should generate either high or low rewards our theoretical investigation reveals that reward collapse is primarily due to the insufficiency of the rankingbased objective function to incorporate promptrelated information during optimization this insight allows us to derive closedform expressions for the reward distribution associated with a set of utility functions in an asymptotic regime to overcome reward collapse we introduce a promptaware optimization scheme that provably admits a promptdependent reward distribution within the interpolating regime our experimental results suggest that our proposed promptaware utility functions significantly alleviate reward collapse during the training of reward models

large language models llms especially those accessed via apis have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains however users without technical expertise often turn to untrustworthy thirdparty services such as prompt engineering to enhance their llm experience creating vulnerabilities to adversarial threats like backdoor attacks backdoorcompromised llms generate malicious outputs to users when inputs contain specific triggers set by attackers traditional defense strategies originally designed for smallscale models are impractical for apiaccessible llms due to limited model access high computational costs and data requirements to address these limitations we propose chainofscrutiny cos which leverages llms unique reasoning abilities to mitigate backdoor attacks it guides the llm to generate reasoning steps for a given input and scrutinizes for consistency with the final output any inconsistencies indicating a potential attack it is wellsuited for the popular apionly llm deployments enabling detection at minimal cost and with little data userfriendly and driven by natural language it allows nonexperts to perform the defense independently while maintaining transparency we validate the effectiveness of cos through extensive experiments on various tasks and llms with results showing greater benefits for more powerful llms
artificial neural networks anns have become a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships in largescale datasets however their blackbox nature poses trustworthiness challenges in certain situations ensuring trust in predictions might require following specific partial monotonicity constraints however certifying if an alreadytrained ann is partially monotonic is challenging therefore anns are often disregarded in some critical applications such as credit scoring where partial monotonicity is required to address this challenge this paper presents a novel algorithm lipvor that certifies if a blackbox model such as an ann is positive based on a finite number of evaluations consequently since partial monotonicity can be expressed as a positivity condition on partial derivatives lipvor can certify whether an ann is partially monotonic to do so for every positively evaluated point the lipschitzianity of the blackbox model is used to construct a specific neighborhood where the function remains positive next based on the voronoi diagram of the evaluated points a sufficient condition is stated to certify if the function is positive in the domain unlike prior methods our approach certifies partial monotonicity without constrained architectures or piecewise linear activations therefore lipvor could open up the possibility of using unconstrained ann in some critical fields moreover some other properties of an ann such as convexity can be posed as positivity conditions and therefore lipvor could also be applied

finetuning large language models llms using diverse datasets is crucial for enhancing their overall performance across various domains in practical scenarios existing methods based on modeling the mixture proportions of data composition often struggle with data whose domain labels are missing imprecise or nonnormalized while methods based on data selection usually encounter difficulties in balancing multidomain performance to address these challenges in this work we investigate the role of data diversity in enhancing the overall abilities of llms by empirically constructing contrastive data pools and theoretically deriving explanations building upon the insights gained we propose a new method that gives the llm a dual identity an output model to cognitively probe and select data based on diversity reward as well as an input model to be tuned with the selected data extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domainundetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced llms we release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedbackdriven datamodel codesign for llms
influence functions provide crucial insights into model training but existing methods suffer from large computational costs and limited generalization particularly recent works have proposed various metrics and algorithms to calculate the influence of data using language models which do not scale well with large models and datasets this is because of the expensive forward and backward passes required for computation substantial memory requirements to store large models and poor generalization of influence estimates to new data in this paper we explore the use of small neural networks which we refer to as the influencenetwork to estimate influence values achieving up to cost reduction our evaluation demonstrates that influence values can be estimated with models just the size of full language models we use b and b versions we apply our algorithm of estimating influence values called nncift neural networks for efficient instruction finetuning to the downstream task of subset selection for general instruction finetuning in our study we include four stateoftheart influence functions and show no compromise in performance despite large speedups between nncift and the original influence functions we provide an indepth hyperparameter analyses of nncift the code for our method can be found here
to recognize and mitigate the harms of generative ai systems it is crucial to consider who is represented in the outputs of generative ai systems and how people are represented a critical gap emerges when naively improving who is represented as this does not imply bias mitigation efforts have been applied to address how people are represented we critically examined this by investigating gender representation in occupation across stateoftheart large language models we first show evidence suggesting that over time there have been interventions to models altering the resulting gender distribution and we find that women are more represented than men when models are prompted to generate biographies or personas we then demonstrate that representational biases persist in how different genders are represented by examining statistically significant word differences across genders this results in a proliferation of representational harms stereotypes and neoliberalism ideals that despite existing interventions to increase female representation reinforce existing systems of oppression

abductive learning abl integrates machine learning with logical reasoning in a loop a learning model predicts symbolic concept labels from raw inputs which are revised through abduction using domain knowledge and then fed back for retraining however due to the nondeterminism of abduction the training process often suffers from instability especially when the knowledge base is large and complex resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space while prior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space they typically treat the knowledge base as a static black box in this work we propose curriculum abductive learning cabl a method that explicitly leverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the abl training challenges cabl partitions the knowledge base into a sequence of subbases progressively introduced during training this reduces the abduction space throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in a stepwise smooth way experiments across multiple tasks show that cabl outperforms previous abl implementations significantly improves training stability convergence speed and final accuracy especially under complex knowledge setting

does visionandlanguage vl training change the linguistic representations of language models in meaningful ways most results in the literature have shown inconsistent or marginal differences both behaviorally and representationally in this work we start from the hypothesis that the domain in which vl training could have a significant effect is lexicalconceptual knowledge in particular its taxonomic organization through comparing minimal pairs of textonly lms and their vltrained counterparts we first show that the vl models often outperform their textonly counterparts on a textonly questionanswering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts mentioned in the questions using an array of targeted behavioral and representational analyses we show that the lms and vlms do not differ significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself but they differ in how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs a nontaxonomic relation this implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does not change substantially through additional vl training but vl training does improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic

jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the builtin safety mechanisms of large language models automated jailbreaks typically optimize an adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response in this work we show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexitybased filtering on the input prompt to overcome this issue we propose latentbreak a whitebox jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity capable of evading such defenses latentbreak substitutes words in the input prompt with semanticallyequivalent ones preserving the initial intent of the prompt instead of adding highperplexity adversarial suffixes or long templates these words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless requests our extensive evaluation shows that latentbreak leads to shorter and lowperplexity prompts thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms against perplexitybased filters on multiple safetyaligned models

extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech signal processing mel frequency cepstral coefficients mfcc are the most widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition applications as the filtering in this feature is ilar to the filtering taking place in the human ear but the main drawback of this feature is that it provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the information about at what time which frequency is present the wavelet transform with its flexible timefrequency window provides time and frequency information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of nonstationary signals like speech on the other hand because of its uniform frequency scaling a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in analysing speech signals have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies and be less in line with human auditory perception hence it is necessary to develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both mfcc and wavelet transform a great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features the present wavelet transform based melscaled feature extraction methods require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of melscale filtering since it adds extra processing steps here we are proposing a method to extract mel scale features in time domain combining the concept of wavelet transform thus reducing the computational burden of timefrequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction combining our proposed time domain mel frequency wavelet coefficienttmfwc technique with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the efficiency of audio signal processing

medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as disease diagnosis treatment planning and disease development monitoring because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical structures that directly influence treatment decisions convolutional neural networks significantly impact image segmentation however since convolution operations are local capturing global contextual information and longrange dependencies is still challenging their capacity to precisely segment structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this restriction since transformers use selfattention methods to capture global context and longrange dependencies efficiently integrating transformerbased architecture with cnns is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges to address these challenges we propose the focal modulation and bidirectional feature fusion network for medical image segmentation referred to as fmbffnet in the remainder of this paper the network combines convolutional and transformer components employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to refine context awareness and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations across scales through this design fmbffnet enhances boundary precision and robustness to variations in lesion size shape and contrast extensive experiments on eight publicly available datasets including polyp detection skin lesion segmentation and ultrasound imaging show that fmbffnet consistently surpasses recent stateoftheart methods in jaccard index and dice coefficient confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse medical imaging scenarios

adapterbased training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the capabilities of powerful foundation image generators enabling personalized and stylized texttoimage synthesis these adapters are typically trained to capture a specific target attribute such as subject identity using singleimage reconstruction objectives however because the input image inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors adapters are prone to entangle the target attribute with incidental ones such as pose expression and lighting this spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs the models ability to adhere to the input text prompt in this work we uncover a ple yet effective solution provide the very shortcuts we wish to eliminate during adapter training in shortcutrerouted adapter training confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules such as controlnet or lora eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them the auxiliary modules are then removed during inference when applied to tasks like facial and fullbody identity injection our approach improves generation quality diversity and prompt adherence these results point to a general design principle in the era of large models when seeking disentangled representations the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what should not be learned
